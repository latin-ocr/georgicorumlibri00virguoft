NOTES.

“ ad initium ejus sylvae dicat, quum people call the bubalus, urus; but

‘⁴ dierum iter Lx processerit, aut quo
“ ex loco oriatur, acceperit. Multa
“ in ea genera ferarum nasci constat,
“ quae reliquis inlocis visa non sint:
“ ex quibus quae maxime differant
“ ab caeteris, et memoria prodenda
“ videantur, haec sunt.'’ After these
words Caesar describes a bull shaped
like a stag, the elk, and theurus,
as in the former quotation. Servius
thinks the zm· are su, called ἀπὸ τῷν
ὀρῶν, from molmtains: but it is
more probable that the Romans only
latinised the German name Aaroclzs
or Ura-hs, for the ancient Germans
called any thing wild, vast, or strong,
ur ‚· and oclzs, in their language
The uri therefore
mentioned by 'Virgil cannot be the
urus described by Caesar, which
was an animal utterly unknown
in Italy. To solve this difficulty,
La Cerda would have us read tauri
instead of uri.- but then what shall
we do with ver. 53⁶2. of the third
Georgick?

‘⁶ Quaesitas ad sacra boves Junonis et
“ Ur2·s.·’›

for here tauris instead of uris cannot
stand in the xerse. The same Com-
mentator proposes another solution,
to read ursi instead of 11722': but this
is a mere conjecture. Ruaeus inter-
pret-⁶² sylvestres urz· ‘² Bubali quos
‘⁶ vulgus cum Uris confundit. Plin.
“ l. 8. 15.” This is nota fair in-
terpretation of Pliny’s words: that
author does not say the common

that they call the υνυς, bubalus.-
“ Paucissima Scythia gignit, inopia
“ fruticum: pauca contermina illi
‘⁴ Germania: insignia tamen boum
‘² ferorum genera, jubatos, bisontes,
‘⁶ excellentique et vi et velocitate
“ uros, quibus imperitum vulgus
“ bubalorum nomen imponit, cum id
“ gignat Africa, vituli potius cervive
‘⁶ quadam similitudine.'’ The Bet-
baliis of Pliny seems to be that which
Bellonius describes under the name of
Bos Africanus, which he says is less

‘than a stag, of a square make, with

reddish shining hair, and horns bend-
ing towards each other, in form ot·
a half moon. It is therefore very
different from the lefalo, which is
common in Italy, of the milk ot·
which they make, those fine cheeses,
which they call casei di cavallo ,· it is
larger than the common kine, has a.
thicker body, a very hard skin, and ‚
thick, bending black horns. Ι do
not find that this animal was distin-
guished anciently by any particular
name: and therefore virgil might
probably borrow the name of Uram,
which was known to signify the wild
bull of the Hercynian forest. La
Cerda quotes a passage of S. Isidore,
to shew that the Babulus was com-
mon in Italy in his time, which was
very ancient. The words of S. Isi..
dore are: ‘⁶ ssoas anguis [taliae im-
“ mensa mole: persequitur greges
“ armentorum et bubalos.- et plurimo
‘⁶ lacte irriguis uberibus se innectit,
“ et surgens interimit, atque inde a
“ boum populatione boas nomen ac..'

1 ‘⁶ cepit.”
