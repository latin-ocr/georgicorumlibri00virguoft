GEORG. LIB. IV.

Tristior hybernas caelo descendit in undas.
Illis ira modum supra cst, laesaeque venenum
{Morsibus inspirant, et spicula caeca relinquunt
Adfixae venis, animasque in vulnera ponunt.
Sin duram metues hyemem, parcesque futuro,
Contusosque animos, et res miserabere fractas; 240
At suffire thymo, cerasque recidere inanes

235 descends moui-nfully into the
waters ot' winter. They are
wrathful above measure, and if
they are offended they breathe
venom into their stings. and
leave their hidden darts fixt to
the verns, and part with their
lives in the wounds that they
inflict. But if you are afraid
ofa hard winter, and would
provide for futurity, and take
pity on their broken strength.
aud ruined affairs, yet who
, would hesitare to fumigate
them with thyrne. and cut

away the empty wax?

Hydra, which Ruaeus thinks is the
constellation intended, I cannot think
Virgil would call it a fish.

<236. Illis ira modum supra επ]
He now assigns a reason for spirting
water and smoaking them: because
otherwise, being animals of strong
resentment, they would revenge their
quarrel on the person who should of.
scr to assail them.

Pierius found super instead of su-
pra in some ancient manuscripts.

238. Adfioeae venes] Pierius found

adfixa venis in a very ancient manu-

script, and aclnz'xce venis in the ob-
long one. Itis affixa z'n venis in one
of the Arundelian manuscripts, and
adfixa z‘n venis in the other, making
affixa to agree with spicula, which is
not amiss.

Animasque in vulnera pomum]
So Ι read with one of the Arundelian
manuscripts, and Heinsius. Pierius
found the same in thc Roman, and
other manuscripts. The common
reading is vulnere.

It is said to be a vulgar error, that
Bees lose their lives with their
stings.

239. Sin duram metues, &c.] The
Poet now proceeds to spcak of the
manner in which those hives should
be treated, where the honey is not

taken, but left to support the Bees in
winter, and mentions the plagues that
inscst them.

fiscalem] Pierius found metuensin
some ancientrnanuscripts. lt is φης’-
tuens also in the King’s manuscript.

240. sztzawsqua] ln the King's
manuscript it is coneus-sosque.

miserabere] In the King's manu-
script it is miserabile.

241. At sztffi're thyma] Pierius
found autin some os the old manu-
scri ts.

Tphc sense seems to bc, tho’ you
think fit not to benerit yoursell'by
depriving them of their honey, yet
it will be worth the while to take
some pains about preserving them.

This fumigation is recommended
also by other authors. Varro says
it should be twice or thrice in a
mouth, during the summer: ‘⁴ Ver..
“no tempore et aestiro scrc ter in
“ mense mcllarius inspicere debet su-
‘⁴ migans leviter eas, ct a spurcitiis
“ purgare alvum, et vermiculos eji-
“ cere.'’

Ceras-que recidere inanes] Servius
seems to understand the Poet to mean,
that some wax should be cut into
small pieces, and given the Becssor

by May: ,
