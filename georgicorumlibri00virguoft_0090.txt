bull by the aversum astrum: sor that
constellation is known to rise back-
wards. 'rhus Manilius:

⁴‘ Aversus venit in caelum.⁷’

It seems more natural to suppose that
virgil should mean the bull, which
he had just mentioned, than the ship,
which he lias not once named in the
whole poem. Dryden translates this
passage:

‘³ When with the. golden horns, in
“ full carcer,

“ The bull beats down the barriers
‘⁴ of the ycar;

²¹ And Argos and the Dog forsakc
“ the northern sphere.”

ΜΓ. B—’s translation is.reconcilable
with the sense. which l. have proposed:

“ When with his horns the bull un·
‘⁶ bars the year3

‘⁴ And frigliten'd fiies the dog, and
“ sliuns the adverse star.”

Dr. Trapp has followed Ruaeus:

When now with golden

 

·‘ horns

⁴⁴ The shining bull unlocks the op'n-
‘⁶ ing year,

⁴· And, Setting, to thc sbip the dog
‘⁶ gives way.''

The sun enters Taurus, according
to Columella, on the seventeenth of
April, as Ι obsera-ed, at the beginning
of this note. According to the. same

author, the dog sets with the sun, on
the last day of the same month:
‘⁶ Pridie calendas Maias canis se ves·
“ pere celat.’' Pliny says, that ac-
cording to the Boeotians and Athe-
nians, it is on the twenty-sixth of
April; but, according to the Assy-
rians, on the twenty-ninth: “ Sexto
“ calendas Maii ssoeotiae et Atticae
“ canis vesperi occultatur, fidicula
“ mane oritur: quinto calendas As-
“ syriae Orion totus absconditur, ter-
“ tio autem canis.'.'

219. Triticeam in messem] The
triticum of the ancients was not our
common or lammas wheat, but a
boarded sort. Hence arista, which
signifies the heard, is often used by
the Poets for wheat: hut it would be
too violent a figure to put the heard
for corn, which has no beard at all.
Cicero, in his Cato mqu, speaking of
the pleasures of husbandmen, gives
a beautiful description of the growth
os corn, and mentiens the heard as a
palisade, to defend the grain: “ Me
·‘ quidem non fructus modo‚sed etiam
“ ipsius terrae vis, ac natura delec-
“ tat: quae cum gremio mollito ac
“ subacto semen sparsum accepit:
‘⁴ primum occaecatum cohibet: ex
“ quo occatio, quae hoc efficit, no-
“ minata cst: deinde tepefactum va-
“ pore, et complexu sue, diffundit,
“ et elicit herbescentem ex eo viri·
“ ditatem: quae nixa fibris stirpium,
‘⁴ sensim adolescit, culmoque erecta
“ geniculato, vaginis jam quasi pu-
“ bescens includitur, e quibus cum
