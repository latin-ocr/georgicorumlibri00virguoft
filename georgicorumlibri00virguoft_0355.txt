The passage from Carthago to Sicily
is very short, and the games in ho-
nour of Anchises, were celebrated on
the tenth day after the arrival os
AEneas in Sicily. Iris therefore, in
the form of Beroe, could not mean
it was the summer 5035011, when
these games were celebrated ; since
it has been evidently proved that it
was the winter season, or, at most,
early in the spring.

AEstas however, in the passage
now under consideration, may mean
only the summer, which is the very
name, as is he had said annus· The
time sor cavering mares, according

’ north wind,

to Varr0, as Ι have quoted him, in
the note 011 ver. 133, is from the ver.
nal equinox to the summer solstice=
and the mares, according to the same
author, bring forth in eleven months
and ten days. 'she time therefore
osa colt’s coming into the world is
from the beginning of March to the
beginning of June. The summer was
reckoned to begin a little before the
middle of May. Thus the fourth sum.
mer of a colt's life will be when he is
completely three years old.

196. Hyperboreis] The Hyper«
boreans are a people of whom not
only the seat, but even the existence
is called in question. The mention
os them is very ancient, sor we find
Herodotus denying that there were
any such people3 and not without
reason, if by Hyperborean be meant,
as he understands the word, a people
who lived beyond the rising of the
ssut others, as Strabo
tells us in his first book, call those
Hyperboreans, who live in the most
northern parts of the world: Τοῦ
