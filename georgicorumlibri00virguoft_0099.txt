Under the torrid or burm‘ng zone
lies that part of the earth, which is
contained between the. two tropicks.
This was thought by the ancients to
be uninhabitable‚ because of the ex-
cessive heat3 but later discoveries
have shown it to beinhabited by many
great nations‚ lt contains a great
part of Asia, Africa‚andSouth Ame-
rina. Under the twofrigicl or cold
<bones lie those parts of the carth,

thch are included within the two
polar cheles, which are so cold, being
at a great distance from the sun, ἃς
to be scarce habitable. within the
arctic circle, near the north pole, are
contained Nova Zembla‚ Lapland,
Groenland, &c. Within the antarc-
tic circle near the south pole, no land
has yet been discovered: tho⁷ the
great quantities of ice found there
make it probable that there is more
land near the, north, than the south
pole. Under the two temperate zones
are contained those parts of the globe‚
which lie between the tropicks‚ and
polar circles. The temperate zone,
between the arctic circle and the tro-
pick of Cancer, contains the greatest
part of Europe and Asia3 part of
Africa, and almost-111 north America.
That between the antarctic circle and
the tropick of Capricorn contains
part of south America, or the Anti-
odes.
