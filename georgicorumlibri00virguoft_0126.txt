NOTES.

351. Atque hoec, Sco] La Corda,
and after him Ruaeus, and several
other commentators, understand the
Poet in this passage to say, there are
two ways of predicting the wcather,
one by Astrology, to which purpose
he mentions the moon3 the other by
common observation. But he has
alreadyinsisted sufficiently on the nse
of the astrological science, and now
intends only to show the husband-
man, how, without scienee, heinay be
able. in a good measure, to foresee
the changes of the weatlier, and pre-
vent the inisfortunes that may attend
them. Grimoaldus has justly para-
phrased the passage under our consi-
deration to this purpose: “ Sed
‘⁶ qnoniam rustici homines, ct ope-
“ rarii ex Saturni caeterorumque sy-
“ derum conversionibus parum aut
“ nihil possunt colligere, ea de tem-
“ pestatinn indiciis, ac praenotioni-
‘⁴ bns dicam, quae sunt pene ad vul..
‘⁵ garern popularemque sensum ac-
“ commodata, ὅκκ’)

the same reading.

353. Moneret] It is moveret in
one of Dr. Mead's manuscripts, and
in some of the old printed editions.

354. Quo signa] “ Vel quo sub
‘⁶ sirlere; vel melius qno indicio in-
‘⁵ telligi posset ventos deficere-’⁷ says

Ruaeus. Ῑ have already observed that
Virgil has no astrological meaning in
this passage τ whence we must prefer
with Ruaeus, this latter interpre-
tation. Dr. Trapp adheres to the
former:

“ Beneath what star ,⁶
‘⁶ Auster's rough blasts should sall.''

 

Cadwent] La Cerda observes,
that from the context of virgil it
appears, that caderent must signify
not the ceasing or falling of the
wind, but its rnshing down to occa-
sion storms. He quotes a passage of
Terentius Varro in Sesquiulysse, to
confirm this interpretation: Adversi
venti ceciderunt, quod sipergzcnt di-
utizcs mare volvere, vereor, ὅτε. Ι
cannot find that Virgil has ever used
caclo in this sense: but he has used it
for the ceasing of the wind in the
ninth Eclogue :

ὅ( Et nunc omne tibi stratum silet
“ aequor, et omnes,

‘⁴ Aspice, ventosi ceciderunt mur-
‘4 muris aurae.’'

Mr. Β ’s translation agrees with
