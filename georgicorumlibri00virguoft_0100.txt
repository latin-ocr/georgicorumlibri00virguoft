111161· mediamque duae mortalibus aegris

Via secta per ambas,

Obliquus qna se signorum verteret ordo.

Mundus 111 ad Scythiam ijlumsqne arduus arces 240

Hic vertex semper nobis sublimi& at illum

Sub pedibus Styx atra videt, Manesque profundi.

NOTES.

So glacie concrcloe alque imbribus
atris must be understood as the cause,
that these zones are blue· Pierius
sarther observes, that some manu-
scripts have coeruleoe et glacie ,· which
reading, tho' he does not approve,
yet he thinks it a. confirmation of σα»-
raleoe. ln the King's manuscript it
is coerulea et glacie.

238. Blzmere concessa? (ἶὶυῦηι. Via
secta per ambas, obliquus qua se sig-
norum verteret orda] So I point
11115 verse with Heinsius: most of the
editors have a comma, or a semicolon
aster (liescmf Here the Poettlescribes
the Zocliack, which is a broad belt
spreading about five or six degrces on
’611611 side of the Ecliptick line, and
contains the twelve Constellations or
Sigus. They are Aries, Il'azcrus,
Gfflnim‘, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra,
Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus,
Aquarius, Pisces, The Ecliptick'
line cuts the Equinoctial obliquely in
two opposite points, whence the
Poet calls the Zodiack obliquus sig-
norum ordo. It traverses the whole
tort-id Zone, but neither of? the tem-
perate Zones3 so that per ambas
-must mean between, not tlzro' them.

Thus presently after, speaking of the.

Dragon, he says it twines per duas
Arctos: now that constellation can.
not be said to twine thro* the two

1361115, bnt between them. The 202
diack is the annual path of the sun,
thro' each sign of which 116 passes 111
about the space os a mouth. He 15
said to be 111 0116 of those signs, when
he appears in that part of the heavens,
where those stars are, of which the
sign is composed.

Η6 speaks here of the two poles of
the world. He says the north pole
15 elevated, because that only 15 visi-
ble in these parts of the earth: and
sor the same reason he speaks of the
south pole, as being (lepressed. These
lines seem to be an imitation of Ara-
