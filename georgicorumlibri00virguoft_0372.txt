⁶⁶ bus tanto flagrent ardore co'eundi
⁶⁶ foeminae, ut etiam si marem non
⁶⁶ habeant, assidua et nimia cupidi-
⁶⁶ tate figurantes sibi ipsae venerem,
“cohortalium more avium, rento
⁶⁶ concipiant. Quae enim poeta li-
⁶⁶ centius dicit: Scilicet unte onz-
⁶⁶ nes, &a Cum sit notissimum
⁶⁶ etiam in Sacro monte Ilispaniae,
⁶⁶ qui procurrit in occidentem juxta
⁶⁶ oceanum, frequenter equas sine
⁶⁶ coitu ventrem pertulisse, foetum-
⁶⁶ que educasse, qui tamen inutilis
⁶⁶ est, quod triennio prius quam
‘⁶ adolescat,morteabsumitur. Quare,
⁶⁶ ut dixi, dabimus operam, ne circa
⁶⁶ aequinoctium vernum equae desi-
⁶⁶ deriis naturalibusangantur.’' Pli-
ny mentions Lisbon as a place fa-
mous for mares conceiving by the
west wind: ⁶⁶ Oppida memorabilia
⁶⁶ a Tago in ora, Olisippo equarum
⁶⁶ e favonio vento conceptu nobile.'’
In another place he says, it is well
known, that in Portugal, about
Lisbon and the river Tagus, the
mares turn themselves against the
west wind, are impregnated by it,
and bring forth colts os exceeding
swiftness, but dying at three years
{oldz ⁶⁶ Constat in Lusitania circa

⁶⁶ pernicissimum ita, sed triennium

⁴tations are sufficient to shew, that
it was generally believed by the An-
cients that mares were impregnated
by the western wind. We see that

even the grav-est prose writers assert
the truth of this, and that they even
bring forth colts, which live three
years, Virgil however is very cau..
tious: he does not mention the colt53
but supposes only a salse conception,
within which bounds Aristotle alone
contains himself, of all the writers
whom we have just now quoted.
The west wind, or Zephyrus, was al-
ways reckoned to lead on the spring,
and to infuse a genial warmth thro’
the whole creation. Pliny says this
wind opens the spring, beginning
usually· to blow about the eighth
of February3 and that all vegetables
are married to it, like the mares in
Spain: ⁶⁶ Primus est conceptus, flare
⁶⁶ incipiente vento Favonio circiter
⁶⁶ fere sextum Idus Februarii. Hoc
⁶⁶ enim maritantur vivescentia e te'r.

⁶⁶ casu aequinoctiali, ver inchoans.
⁶⁶ Catulitionem rustici vocant, gesti-
⁶⁶ ente natura semina accipere, eaque
⁶⁶ animam inferente omnibus satis.”
Thus also our Poet, in the second
Georgick:

‘⁶ Parturit almus ager= Zephyrique
⁶⁶ tepentibus auris

⁶⁶ Laxant arva sinusa superat tener
⁶⁶ omnibus humor.''

How sar the mares are really affected,
we must leave to be decided by the
Philosophers of Spain and Portugal,
But that hens will lay eggs without

the assistance of the cock, is a well
known
