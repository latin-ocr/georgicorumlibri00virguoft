have rendered uno ‹le- cespite, sor I
take cespes in this placenot to signify
the earth or turs, but radix cespitasa,
a root whose fibros are thick mat-
ted together so as to form a kind of
turs. Non cle terra, secl (Ie radice,
says Philargy'rius. From this root
arise a vast number of stalks, which
virgil poetically calls a great wood,
ingentem sylvam. 'she flower is of
that sort which Botanists call a ra-
diated discous tlowcr: the disk is yel-
low, and the ray purple. To make
this plain to those who are not ac-
quainted with Botany, I have added
a figure of this plant. A, represents
the yellow disk, which Virgil calls
the flower itself: (mrem- ipse. Β,
represents the rays or purple leaves
which surround the flower3f0liz's‚

Cui nomen turcella] He uses the

' dative case here after the manner of

the Greeks 3 as in other places,
‘⁶ Cui nomen Iulo,’' and “ Cui Re.
‘⁶ mulo cognomen erat.''

⁶272. Fecere agricolam] The Poct
⁴tells us Amellus is a rustic name,
not that by which it was known at
Rome, and. among the writers of Na.
tural History. ⁷

273. Una] It is imo in one of
Dr. Mcad’s manuscripts, and in se-

veral old printed editions, and in
mostmanuscript copieS, according to
Pierius ε but uno is generally receiv-
ed, as the true reading.

274. Aureus ipse, δια] Virgil
plainly speaks of the flower, as being
golden or yellow, which Columella
mistook, not being acquainted with
this herb himself3 for he makes it a.
yellow shrub with purple flowers:
‘⁴ Optime tamen facit amelli radix,
‘⁶ cujus est frutex luteus, purpureus
‘⁶ ssos.'’ lzuaeus rightly interprets
this description of virgil: ‘⁶ Quip-
ζ( pe uno e cespite erigit magnam co-
‘4 piam caulium: aureusipse est, sed
‘⁴ purpura violae nigricantis sublucet
‘⁶ in soliis, quae multa in orbem am.
‘⁶ hiunt ssoscula.” But our Trans-
lators have greatly erred: for May
represents the leaves of the stalk as
being purple z

‘⁶ For from one roote he spreads a
“ wood of boughes,

‘⁴ those many leaves, although the
‘⁶ flower be gold,

‘⁴ Black violets dimme purple colour
“ hold.⁷’
