Truncus is properl) a stock of a
tree, divested of it's head: hence
these taleae, or branchos, with their
heads cut 0ss* are called trunci. The
French derive their word troncon
from trzmczzs; and hence comes our
word lruncheon.

rally too severe, to suffer olive-trees
to be. planted in the open ground.
The way of propagating them here
is by laying down their tendet
branchos, and taking them from the
mother-plant in about two years.
This method is so tedious, that most
people choose to have them from Italy
in the spring. They are usually
planted in pots or cases, and removed
into the green-house at the approach
of winter.

of vines by layers: which is still
practised. [t is found by experience
to be a better way to propagate them
by cuttings3 the description of which

ΜΓ. Miller: ‘⁶ You should always
