NOTES.

According to Pliny the Balsam
pl tnt grows ³'only in Judaea1but Jo-
sophus tells us, that the Jews had a
tradition, that it was first brought
into their country by the Queent> of
Sheba‚ who presented it to Solomon :
Λέγουσι δ’ ὅτι καὶ τῆν τοῦ ὄποςαλσάμου
ἑῖζαιι ἢν ἔτι ν’ὗν ἦμῶν ἦ χῶξα. φέρει, δούσης
ταύτης vis ’γυναικὸς ἔχομεν. According
to the best accounts of modern au-
thors the true country of the Balsam
plant is Arabia Felix. It is a shrub
with unequally pennated leaves. The
Balsam flows out of the branches,
either naturally, 01· by making inci-
sions in June, July, and August. It
is said to be white at first, then green,
and at last of a yellow colour, like
that of honey.

Baccas semper frondentis Acanthi]
The Acanthus is mentioned several
times by Virgil. In this place he
speaks ofit as a tree, that bears ber-
ries, and is always green. In the
fourth Georgick‚ he seems to speak
ofit as a twining plant :

ζ(

 

flexi tacuissem vimen Acan-
“ tki.”

A little afterwards he mentions it as
a garden plant:

“ Ille comam mollis jam tum tonde-
“ bat Acanthi.”

In the third Eclogue he describes two
cups adorned with the figure of it. ·

“ Et nobis idem Alcimedon duo po-
“ cula fecit· ‚

“ Et molli circum est ansas amplexus
“ Acantho. ’'

This verse is taken from the first
Idyllium of Theocritus:

Παντέί ξ’ ἀμφὶ δέπας πεξιπένῖίοιται ὑγρὸς
‚l
ακαν ῦς,

In the fourth Eclogue it is repre-
sented as a beautiful plant :

“ Mixtaque ridenti Colocasia fundet
“ Acantho.'’

In the first AEneid he speaks of a
Garment wrought with yellow silk,
in the form of Acanthus leaves ;

⁴‘ Et circumtextum croceo velamen
‘⁶ Acantho .·''

And

(ζ

 

h Pictum croceo velamen Acan-
“ t o.'

It seems scarce possible, to find any
one plant, with which all these cha-
racters agree. Hence it has not been
unreasonably supposed, that there are
two sorts of Acanthus; the one au
Egyptian tree, of which the Poet
speaks in this place3 and the other an
herb, to which the other passages al-
lude. The tree is described by Theo-
phrastus. He says it is called Acan-
thus, becauseit is all over prickly, ex-
cept the trunk: for it has thorns upon
the shoots and leaves. It is a large
nee, and affords timber of twelve

cubits.
