But it seems most probable that Vir-
gil means the πίῃ out of which the
clouds may properly bc said to be ga-
thered. In this sense Dryden has
translated it ε

“ And oft whole shects descend of
“ slucy rain,

“Oft gathcr from the deep the

the sun:

‘⁶ Sol ruit interea, et montes umbran-

In the fifth AEnchl, hc usesit for the
falling of a great shower in a tem-
pest:

“ —- ·-- - Effusis imbribus atra
“ Tempestas εἱειο more furit: toni-
“ truquc tremiscunt

Virgil uses ruit, in the-

“ Ardua terrarum, et campi: ruit
“ aethere toto

“Turbidus imber aqua, densisque
“ nigerrimus austris.”

Martial uses caelum ruebat, when he
is speaking of a very great shower of
ram ε

‘4 Imbribus *immodicis caelum nam
“ forte ruebat.’'

virgil is thought, in this deschption
os a ssood, to have had in his mind a,
passage iu the sixtecnth Iliad:

“ Loud roars the deluge till it meets

“ And trembling man sees all his la- “

“ bours vain.''
