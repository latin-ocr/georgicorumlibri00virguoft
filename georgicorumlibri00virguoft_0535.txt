Ver. 416. By the fate of things α

the Epicurean principle.

Ver. 419. Aut qzcoe densa relaxat3
sor it is impossible that both should
happen in the same instant. ξ

Ver. 462. Ι never could be re..
coneiled to qaid cogitet humidus Aze-
ster. I had rather read cogat et or
concitet (contra omnes codices) than
cogitet.

Georg. ΙΙ. ver. 10. Those that
rise from suckers, or from scattered
seeds. Thereis no occasion, Ι think,
to resort to the old opinion of spon-
taneous generation-

Ver. ΞΟ. Hos natura modos pri-
mum dedit, are those which rise sponte
sua.

Ver. 2‘2. Ι cannot construe this
line without reading Sunt alii queis
ipse riam sibi repperit usus. The
aliz· (viz. modi) quei-0, 650. answers
what went before, His gemas omne.

Ver. 59. This relates to the semi-
nibus jactis. The apples produced
from kernels do not taste like the
apples that produced the kernels.

Ver. 60. So the kernels of a bunch
of grapes produce turpes racemos. I
never saw a vine raised from a ker-
ne13 but a curious friend of mine in-
formed me he had seen in Barbadoes
vines raised from the kernels of rai-
sins.

Ver. 149. It would somewhat a-
bate Virgil's compliment to his own
country, if, with ΜΓ. Β -. we were
to attribute the Ver assiduum only to
foreign grasses.

Ver. 357. Presso vomere signifies
deep plowing. Mr. Dryden trans-

Georg. III. ver. 52. I think none
of the quotations expound turpe cce-
put. But if it is like the bull⁷s,
which Virgil recommends, ver. 58.
it will be turpe. The curling of the
hair upon the head will retain more
dust and chaff than is lodged upon a.
smooth headed cowg so that the
meaning is rather rough or shock-
headed than large. A cow with a.
large long neck and a great head
would be a monstreris improportion-
able figure.

I take plurima cervix to be thick
necked. virgil says omnia magna3
that is, proportionably so.

Ver. 85. But what ignis is this?
It is either the smoke of his nostrils,
or the remarkable flame colour of the
fine membrane within them. The
action of neighing throws the blood
over the membrano, and makes the
flame colour appear more red and
lively3 and this answers every parta
of the verse, viz. premens collectum.

take to be the glory of his nostrils.

Ver. 87. Duplex spina, a kind of
furrow thrown up on each side of the
spine, by which the spine itself would
not be seen, but each furrow would
look like a spine.

Ver. 106. Verbere torto rather
describes the manner of lashing, than
the whip or lash.

Ver. 130. Dryden and B--have
