NOTES.

another place he has a chapter de
Nuce Juglande, where he says ex-
pressly‚ that the walnut is ingrafted
on the arbute: “ Inseritur, ut ple-
“ rique asserunt, mense Februario,
‘⁶ in Arbuto.” We have nux but
once more in all Virgil: it is in the
eighth Eclogue ι

“ Mopse novas incide faces: tibi du-
“ citur uxor.

“ Sparge marite nucem tibi deserit
“ Hesperus OEtam.

Divinus.

The ancient custom of throwing
nuts amongst the boyS, at weddingS,
is well known. We learn from Pliny
that these nuts were walnuts: and
that they were used in the nuptial
ceremonies, because the fruit is so
well defended with a thick rind, and
a woody shell: ‘⁶ Ab his locum am-
“ plitudine vindicaverunt, quae ces-
“sere autoritati, nuces juglandes,
“ quanquam et ipsae nuptialium Fes-
“ cenniorum comites, multum pineis
“ minores universitate, eaedemque
‘⁴ portione ampliores nucleo. Nec-
“ non et honor his naturae peculiaris,
“ gemino pro tectis operimento, pul-
“ vinati primum calycis, mox lignei

“ putaminis. Quae causa eas nup-
“ tiis fecit religiosas, tot modis foetu
“ munim, quod est verisimilius, quam
‘⁴ quia cadendo tripudium sonumve
“ faciant.’'

Plurima] Servius interprets this
word longa, and thinks it is designet}
to express the long shape of the al-
mond. Dr. Trapp under-stands it to
mean the tallness of the tree:

“ Observe too, when in woods the
“ almond tall

‘⁴ Blossoms with flow’rs, and bends
“ it's smelling boughs.’'

1 take it to signify very much, or plen-
tifully: in which sense it is to be un-
derstood in the following passage of
the second Georgick:

“ Haec eadem argenti rivos, aerisque
“ metalla

“ Ostendit venis, atque auro plurima
‘⁶ fluxit.''

Here Ruaeus interprets the three last
words auro multum abundarit: and
Dr. Trapp translates these lines;

“ The same blest region veins of sil-
“ ver shews,

“ Rivers of brass; and flows in co-
“ pious gold.”

A few lines after we find

‘⁴ Indicio est, tractu surgens oleaster
“ eodem
“ Plurimus.”
