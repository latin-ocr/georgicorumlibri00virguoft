two days: in 1116111 the livers were
blacker than usual, and in two os
them there were several bags, filled
with 6 petrified substance like chalk,
about the bigness of a pea. Their
gall-bladders were twice their natu-
ral bigneSS‚ and filled with a greener
bile than the first. Their sweet-
breads were shrivelled, some of their
glands very large and hard, and of a
blackish colour. The glands in their
mesenteries were many os 1116111 five
times as big as naturally, and of a
blackish colour. Their lungs were
inflamed, with several bags forming.
Their intestines were full of red and
black spots. Their ssesh was very
hot, though not altered in eolour.

them there were several bagS, as big
as nutmegs‚ filled with a ehalky sub-

about three times as big as usual, 61111
filled with a deep green 11116. Their

bigness‚ were very bhoek, and in the
pelvis of most of those glands in two
Cows, there was 6 yellow putrefac-
tion‚ of the‘consistence of asandy
stone. Their intestines were os the
colour of a snake, their inner coat
excoriated by purging. Their lungs

were much inssamed, with several
bags containing a yellow purulent
matter, many of them as big as a nut-
meg. Their flesh was extreme hot,
though very little altered in colour-
These were the general appearanoes3
but in some other dissections, he ob-
served the following remarkable par-
ticulars. ln one the bile was petri-
fied in its vessels, and resembled a

another there were several inflamma-
tions on the liver, some as large as
a half-crown‚ cracked round the
edges‚ and appeared separating from
the sound part, like a pestilentia!

All the medicines that were ap-

last suppressed, was this: they di-

by which means they lost only that
