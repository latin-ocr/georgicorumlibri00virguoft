THE PREFACE. xi

resounding of the shoreS, and the murmuring of the woods*,
in the Poet’s numbers, The swift rushing of the North
wind †, and the haste required to catch up a stone to de-
stroy a serpent ‡, are described in words as quick as the sub·

J Digressions are not only permitted, but are thought orna·
mental in a Poem3 provided they do not seem to be stuck on
unartfully, or to ramble too far from the subject. ,Virgil's
are entertaining and pertinent; and he never suffers them to
lose sight of the business in hand. The most liable to ob·
jection seems to be the conclusion of the first Georgick,
where he entertains the reader with a long account of the
prodigies that attended Caesar's death, and of the miseries
'occasioned by the civil wars among the Romans, But here
it may be obser-ved what care the Poet takes not to forget
his subJect. He introduces a husbandman in future ages
turning up rusty spears with the civil plough-share, striking
harrows against empty helmets, and astonished at the gi-
gantic size of the bones. And when he would describe the
whole world in arms, he expresses it by saying the plough
does not receive its due honour, the fields lie uncultivated
by the absence of the husbandmen, and the sickles are-
beaten into swords. The praises of Italy, and the charnis of
acountry life, in the second Georgick‚ seem naturally to
flow from the subject. The violent effeets of lust, in the
third book, are described with a delicacy not to be paralleled.
This was a dangerous undertaking 3 it was venturing to
steer between Scylla and Charybdis. W e need but consult
