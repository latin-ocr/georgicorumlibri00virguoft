tering them, related to a barren soil.
llere he speaks of an inconvenience
attending a rich soil, the too great
luxuriauce of the corn3 and advises
to seed itdown‚wliile it is young. He
seems to have taken this from Theo-
ph rastus, who say& thatin a rich soil
the husbandmen both mow the young
corn, and feed it down to keep it
from running too much to leaf. Ἐν
ἓέ ταῖς ἀγαθαῖς χώραις πρὲς τὸ μὴ φυλλο-
μειιέῖν, ἔπινέμεσι καὶ ἓπικεῖρδσι τὸν σῖτον.
Pliny says the same thing: “Luxuria
“ segetem castigatur dente pecoris in
“ herba ‹lu11taxat.”

speaks ot· ‹lraining a marshy land.

spoken of these labours which attend
the culture of the earth, the l'oet adds
that these are not all ; for birds that
infest the corn are to be scared away,
weeds are to be rooted up, and trees
to be loppml, that overshade the field.

119. Amen] The goose is inju-
rious wheresoever it comes by pluck-
ing every thing up by the roots. Co-
lumella quotes the following words
to this purpose from Celsus: ·‘ Anser
“ neque sine aqua, nec sine multa
“ herba facile sustinetur, neque utilis
“ est locis consitis-‚quia quicquid te-
“ nerum contingere potest carpit.”
Palladius has almost the same words,
and adds that the dung of geese is
hurtful: “ Anser sane nec sine herba,
“ nec sine aqua facile sustinetur:
“ locis consitis inimicus est, quia sata
“ et morsu laedit et stercore.’' This
notiori, of the dung of geese burning
up the grass where they seed, still
prevails amongst our country people.
But Ι have observed that grass will
grow as well under their dung, as
under that of other animals. The
many bare placeS, which are found
where geese frequent, are occasioned
by their drawing up the grass by the
roots.

1³20. Strymonis? grues] The cranes
are said to come from Strymon, a
river of Macedon, on the borders of
Thrace.

Amaris intuba fibris.] Intybum,

Endive: but the plant which virgil
