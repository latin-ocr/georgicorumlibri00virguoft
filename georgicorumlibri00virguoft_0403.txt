a ram to be white, but his palate and
tongue must he white also. For if
these parts of the body are dark or
spottod, the lambs will be dar-k and
spotted too. He adds, that it is the
same with black and red rams; and
that if any regard is had to the wool,
the marks of the male parent are
chiefly to be obser-ved: ‘⁶ Itaque non
‘⁶ solum ea ratio est probandi arietis,
‘⁶ si vellere candido vestitur, sed
‘² etiam si palatum, atquc lingua

of the ram is spotted, the samo de-

Servius accuses Virgil of having
changed the story, sor it was not Pan,
but Endymion, who was said to be
heloved by the moon, on account of
his milk white sheep, with which he
bribed her to his embraces. But I
do n⁴ot remember to have read in
any of the ancient authors, that En-
dymion had any occasion to take
pains to seduce the Moon. On the
contrary, she fell in love with him,
as he lay asleep on the mountain
Latmos, or, as Cicero relatos the
sable, threw him into a sleep on pur.
pose that she might have that op.
portunity of enjoying him: ‘⁶ En..
“ dymion vero, si fabulas audire

Macrobius affirms, that Virgil took

are now lost. The sable itself is
variously related. Probus tells υς,
that Pan being in love with the Moon
offered her the choice os any part of
his ssock: that she choosing the
