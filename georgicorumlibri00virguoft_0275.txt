GEORG. LIB. ΙΙ.

At myrtis validis hastilibus, et bona bello
Cornus: Ityraeos taxi torquentur in arcus.
Nec tiliae laeves, aut torno rasile buxum

Non formam accipiunt‚ferroque cavantur acuto.
Nec non et torrentem undam levis innatat alnus
Missa Pado: nec non et apes examina condunt
Corticibusque cavis, vitiosaeque ilicis alveo.

‘⁶ and sweet corner of your barn. It
“ was for this the Poet praised them,
“ and the epithet was advised, Fruit-
“ fal z'n leaves the elm. In some
‘⁴ parts of Herefordshire they gather
“ them in sacks for their swine and

447. illyr-tus validis hastilibus, et
bona bello cornum] Their spears and
darts were anciently made of xnyrtle
and cornel: but Pliny presel-s the 3511
for these uses: ‘⁴ obedientissima
‘⁶ quecunque in opere fraxinus, ea-
‘⁴ demque hastis corylo melior, corno
“ levior, sorbo lentior.”

In one of Dr. Mead's manuscripts
it is αι bona hello cornu-r.

448. Ityroeos taxi torquentur in m·-
cuss] The Ityraei or Ituroez' were a
people of Coele Syria, famous sor
shooting with a bow·

Pierius says that in some ancient
manuscripts it is cur-cantur instead of
torquentur. Servius, and some of the
old editors, and Schrevelius have cur.
vantur.

449. Tilioe laeves] Pliny says
mollissima tilia, and filice acl mille
usus peteudoe.

Tor-no rasile buxum] Box is well
known to be turned. into a great va.
riety of utensils.

451. Alnus] See the'note on ven
136. of the first Georgick.

452. ilIc'ssa Paula] The Pois a faa
mous river ot' Italy. Alders are said
to grow in abundance 011 it's banks.

453. Ilia-is] ΜΓ. Evelyn asserts,
that the Esczclus of the ancients was
a species of Iler.- ‘⁵ The acorns of
‘⁶ the coccc’gera, 01· ‹laesas-Oak, yield
‘⁶ excellent nourishment sor Rustics,
“ sweet, and little, if at all, inferior
“ to the chesnut, and this, and not
‘⁴ the fagus, was doubtless the true
‘² Escztlzcs of the ancients, the food
‘⁵ ofthe goldenage.’' But itis plain,
that the very tree οἵ which this learn-
ed gentleman speaks, was called [lex.-
by Pliny, for this author says expressly
that the llam bears the coccus or
chermcs berry: “ Omnes tamen has
“ ojus dotes ilex soloprovocat cocc0.’'
The same author says the leaves of
the Est-ulus are sinuated, whereas
those of the Iler are not sinuated:
“ Folia praeter ilicem gravia, car-
‘⁵ nosa, procera, sinuosa lateribus.”
Resides the very name of dwarf-ouk
shews this sort of Ilea: cannot be the
ancient Esculus, which is described
as 3 very large tree. ΜΓ. Evelyn
seems to have thought the dwarf-nuk
or §carlet-Oak to be the Esculus, be-
cause it's acorns are so good to eat:
