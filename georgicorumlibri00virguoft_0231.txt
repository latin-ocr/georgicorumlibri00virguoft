NOTES.

deerunt is the most received reading,
as Pierius found it in the Medicean
and other ancient manuscripts, and
as I have found it in all the manu-
scripts which I have collated.

237. Validis terram proscinde ju-
veneis] He mentions the strength of
the bullocks, to signify that this soil
must be plowed deep. Thus we have
in the first Georgick‚ sortes inver-
tant tauri, in the same sense.

241. Ta spisso vimine qualos] In
one os Dr. Mead’s manuscr3pts it is
tum spisso, δῖε. Pierius says it is
spissos vimine qualos. in the. Lornbard
manuscript 3 but he prefers spisso
vimine, as it is in the Mec‘ricean, and
other copies.

246. Aa] In one of Dr. Mead's

manuscripts it is sat.
⁶247. Sensn torquebit amaror]

Δ In one of the Arundelian manuscripts

it is sensum torquebit amaror, where
sensum seems to bean error of the

tra‘nscriber for sensu.

‘⁴ Amaror is the style of Lucre.
‘⁵ tius, and the true reading3 tho’
‘⁶ many read amaro, making it agree
‘⁵ with senszc.” Snrzvms.

‘⁶ Tho' Servius, and some others
‘⁶ affirm amaror to be the true read-
‘⁶ ing, and taken from Lucretius,

(ί Cam tuimur misceri absinthia,
“ tangit amaror:

‘4 and tho’ Aulus Gellius has col..
‘⁵ lected the testimonies of some very
‘⁶ ancient manuscripts, to support
‘4 this reading; yet amaro is not
‘⁴ amiss‚ as we find it in the most
‘⁴ ancient Roman manuscript. For
‘² sapor may he the nominatim case
‘⁴ both eo faciet and torquebit. In
“ the Lombard and Medicean manu.
‘⁶ scripts it was written amara, but
‘⁴ r has been added with another
‘⁶ hand and ink.” Pmmns.

whicerierius miudes, is the tweririty.t
