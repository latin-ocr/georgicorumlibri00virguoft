(ἶ notum est ex Hebraeo Tyri nomine

‘⁴ quae medii est soni inter T et S
‘⁶ Graeci in T mutarunt, et Romani
‘⁶ in S. Ita sactum utex eodem *m* et

Ruaeus, and Masvicius. All the ma-

538. Hic stupet attonitus rostris]
This seems not to be spoken of the
Orators themselves, but of their
hearers, who are struck with astonish-
ment at the force of their eloquence.
Tho’ the Poet may mean also, that
this admiring of eloquence may stir
up in them a vehement desire of be-
coming Orators. Dryden has made
virgil use abusive language on this
occasion:

“ Some patriot fools to popular praise
“ aspire ¹

‘⁶ Os public speeches, which worse
f‘ fools admir‹:.’{

'Mra Β

 

makes the'astonishment
relate wholly to the Orator himself:

‘⁶ He in the Rostrum lifts to heaven
‘⁴ his eyeS,

‘4 Amaz’d, confounded, speechless
‘⁴ with surprize.”

Butwhy the Orator should be affected
in such a manner, I must own my..
self at a loss to comprehend. Dr.
Trapp seems to understand this ex.
pressiori of the Poet in the same sense
with me:

(ί That doats with fondness on the
‘⁶ Rostrum's fame.”

Hunc plausus, &c.] This is ge.
nerally understood to be meant of
dramatic PoetS, who are ambitious
of a general applause of the whole
audience. The Patricians and Ple-
beians had their different seats or
boxes in the Roman theatre, which,
being extended from the centre to the
circumference, were consequently
narrower at the centre, like so many
wodges, whence they were called
cunei. See the note on ver. 381.
Virgil’s expression seems to mean the
same as if we should now say, others
are fond of (ι general applaase from
the pit, boxeS, and gallerieS.

509. Geminam] Pierius found
geminatus in the Roman, Medicean,
Lombard‚ and other antient manu-

scripts.
