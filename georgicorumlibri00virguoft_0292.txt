mare inferum, or Tyrrheno sea, on
the south, and hythe river Tyber on
the east. The Etrurians are said to
have extended their dominion from the
Alps to the Sicilian sea, whence the
sea, which washes that coast of Italy,
obtained the name of the Tyrrhene,
or Tuscan sea.

The ancient Romans were greatly
addicted to husbandry, and are known
to have had that art in the greatest
esteem. Cato mentions, as an in-
stance of this, that they thought they
could not bestow a greater praise on
any good man, than calling him a
good husbandmau: “Et virum bo-
⁶⁶ num cum laudabant, ita lauda-
⁶⁶ bant, bonum Agricolam, bonum-
‘⁶ que colonum. Amplissime laudari
‘⁶ existimabatur, qui ita laudabatnr.’'
Cicero, in 'nis oration for Sextus
Roscius‚'observes that their ancestors,
by diligently following Agriculture,
brought the Commonwealth to the
fionrishing condition, in which it then
was ε ⁶⁶ Etenim, qui praeesse egro co,
⁶⁶ londo flagitium putes, profecto il-
‘⁶ lum Atilium, quem sua manu spar-
⁶⁶ gentem semen, qui missi erant, con,
‘⁶ venerunt, hominem turpissimum,
⁶⁶ atque inhonestissimum judicares.
⁶⁶ At hercule majores nostri longe

Columella observes that Quintius
Cincinnatus, who was called from the
plough to the Dictatorship, laid down
his ensigns of authority, with greater
joy, than he took them up, and
returned to his bullocks, and little
hereditary farm of four acres: that
C. Fabritius, and Curius Dentatus,
of whom one had driven Pyrrhus out
of Italy, and the other had subdued
the Sabines, cultivated the seven
acres, which they shared with the rest
of the people, with a diligence,
equal to the valour‘ by which they
had obtained them: that the true
offspring of Romulus were hardened
by rural labour, to bear the fatigues
of war, when their country called
sor their aid3 and that they chose
their soldiers out of the country ra-
ther than out of the city: ‘⁶ Verum
