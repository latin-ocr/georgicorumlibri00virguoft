NOTES.

273. Ore omnes versoe in Zephy-
rium] The impregnation of mares
by the wind is mentioned by a great
variety of authors. Homer speaks
of the horses of Achilles, as being
begotten hythe west wind. See the
quotation from Homer, in the note
on magni currus Achillis, ver. 91.

Aristotle sayS, that at the time
the mares have this fury upon them,
they are said to be impregnated by
the wind: for which reason, iu the
island of Crete, they never separate
the mares from the stallionS. WVhen
they are thus affected, they leave the
rest, and run, not towards the east
or west, but towards the north
or south, and suffer no one to come
near them, till either they are quite
tired down, or come to the sea. At
this time they emit something, which
is called Hippomanes, and is gathered
to be used as a charm:
zai ἐξαιεμοέσθειι ’περὶ τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον.

Varro affirms it is a certain truth, that

the wind, at a certain season, as
hens conceive what is called a wind
egg, but that the colts conceived in
this manner do not live above three
years: (( ln foetura res incredibilis est

lumella says great care must be taken
of the mares about their horsing
time, because if they are restrained,
they rage with lust, whence that poi-
son is called ἱππόμανες which excites
a furious lust, like that of mares :
that there is no doubt, but that in
some countries the females burn* with
such vehement desires, that if they
cannot enjoy the male, they con-
ceive hythe wind, like bens: and
that in Spain, which runs westward
towards the ocean, the mares have
frequently foaled‚ without having
had the company osa stallion, but
these soals are useless, because they
die in three years: ‘⁵ Maxime ita-
