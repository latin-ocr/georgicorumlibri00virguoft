22. Non ullo.] So I find it in the
Cambridge, and in one ol Dr. Mead's
manuscripts. Heinsius, Masvicius‚
and several good editors have tho
same reading. Servius, Grinioaldus,
La Cerda, Ruaeus, and inany others
read, nonnullo. Servius gives it this
sense: you who nourish the. seeds
sown by us, with your own seed;
that is, with rain and warnith. La
Cerdo. interprets it; you who pro-
duce new fruits, with some nmvly
discovered seed. I ain loth to depost
from that excellent manuscript of
Heinsius. without very good huson.
And here I think non ullo the best
reading, notwithstanding the ,ern-ut
authorities 1 have quoted against it.
To produce new fruit with some seed
seems to me a xcry povi· expression,
and by no means worihy of virgil.
But to produce nemsi-mes without any
seed,· that is, without being sown by
men, is a very proper expression.
The Poet, in these two lines, invokes„
first. those deities who take care of
spontaneous planis, and then those
who shed their influonee on those
which are sown. Thus, at the he-
ginning of the second Gmrgffk, he
tells us, that some trees coine up of
their own accord, nithout culture,
und that others aro sown:

⁴⁴ Principio arboribus varia est na-
“ tura creandis:

“ Sponte sua veniunt. ·—-—-—--
‘⁴ I'drs autem posito surgunt de sefl-
⁴‘ niiiie.'’

24. Tuque adeo, δικ] After the
invocation of these deitics, he takes
an opportunity οῖ’ making liis court
to Angustus Caesar, by adding him
to the number, aud giving hiin his
clinice, whether he will be a god Of
earth, seu, or lwaven.

Arlco ] §onie think adeo to be only
an expiative here, others interpret it
also. bonius, and after him most of
the Commentators, take it io signify
chiefly.

Ailou] It is generally agreed that
mor in this place signifies hereczfler:
us in Horace:

“ AEtas parentum, pejor avis, tulit
‘⁶ Nos nequiores, mox daturos
“ Progeniem vitiosioi·ein.'’

Itis usual with the Poets to pray that
it may be long before their monarchs
are received into heaveu; thus Ho-
race ε

“ Serus iu caeluni redeas, diuque
‘⁴ Laetus intersis populo Quirini3
‘⁶ Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum
“ Ocyor auru

‘⁶ Tollat.”
