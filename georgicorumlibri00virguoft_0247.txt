Thon winter hinds up the
country with frost, aud does
not suffer the srozen root of
the ¹young plants to take hold
of the earth. The best time
for plantiug viueyards is, when

NOTES.

319. Optima vinetis satio, cam vere
rquentaeZ] Most ofthe printed editions
have est after satio .· but it is wanting
in the King’s‚ the Bodleian, both the
Arumlelian, and both Dr, Moatra·
manuscripts. Heinsius also and Mas-
vicius leave out est.

The epithet rubenti may allude to
the red stowe-rs, which ‚appear in tho
spring: or rather, it may be put sor
bright, or sl1ining; for pmpureus is
used for any briglzt colmar, and the
. spring has often that epithet.

3020. Candida avim} T he stork,
a bird of passage, which comes into
Italy in the spring3 or in summer, uc-
cording to Pliny: ‘⁴ Cicom'oe quo„
‘⁶ nam e loco veniant, aut quo se ref
‘⁶ ferant, incompertum adhuc est. E
“ longinquo venire non dubium, eo-
‘⁴ dem quo grues modo: illas hyemis,
“ has testatis advenas.’'

Longis invisa colubres] Pliny tells
us, that storks are in such esteem, for
destroying serpents, that, in Thessaly,
it is a capital crime to kill them,
and the punishment is tho same as
for murder: “ Honos iis serpen-
“ tium exitio tantus, ut iu Thessa-
‘⁶ lia capitale fuerit occidisse, eadem-
‘⁴ que legibus poena, quae in homi.
‘⁴ cidam.’'

3⁶21. Prima vel autumni sub fri.
gorm] The time which the Poet
means in this place, must be the lat-
⁷ ter end of autumn7 which the Romane

’ ‘⁶ Decembres-‚²²

reckoned to begin on the twelfth of
August. Their winter began on the
niuth of November: and therefore
we may· understand the first cold of
autumn to mean the end of October,
οι· the beginning of November. This
agrees with what Columella has said
about the time ofplanting vinoyards:
that it is either in spring or autumn5
iu spring, if it be a cold or moist cli-
mate, or the soil be sat, or on a plain ;
and iu autumn, is the contrary. He
says the time of planting in the spring
is from the thirteenth of February to
the vernal equinos: in the autumn,
from the fifteenth of October to the
first os December: ‘⁶ Sequitur opus
“ vineae conserendae, quae vel vere
‘⁵ vel autumno tempestive deponitur.
‘⁴ Vere melius, si aut pluvius, aut
‘⁶ frigidus status caeli est, aut ager
a: pinguis, aut campestris, et uligi-
‘⁴ uosa planicies: rursus autumno si
‘4 sicca, si calida est aeris qualitaS, si
‘⁶ exilis, atque aridus campus9 si ma.
(ί cer praeruptusve collis: vernaeque
‘⁶ positionis dies fere quadraginta
“ sunt ab Idibus Februariis usque in
‘⁴ aequinoctium: rursus autumnalis
‘⁶ ab Idibus Octobris in Calendas
Observe that our
Calendar varies a fortnight‚ since the
time it was settled by Julius Caesar:
for the vernal equium, which is now
about the tenth or eleventh of March,
was then about the four or five and

P twentieth.
