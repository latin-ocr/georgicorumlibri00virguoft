P. VIRGILII MARONIS

Pontus, et ostriferi fauces tentantur Abydi.
Libra dies somnique pares ubi fecerit horas,
Et medium luci, atque umbris jam dividit orbem:

NOTES.

207. Pontus] This is commonly
taken to mean the Hellespont: but
that is to be understood by the
streights of Abydos,fauces Abydi. Ι
take it to mean the black or Euxine
sea, which has the character of being
very tempestuous.

Ostrg'feri Abydi] Abydos is situ-
ated on the Asiatic side os the Helle-

spont. It was famous for oysters:
thus Ennius:

“ Mures sunt AEni‚ aspera ostrea plu-
“ rima Abydi?

And Catullus:

“ Hunc lucum tibi dedico, consecro-
“ que, Priape,
“ Qua domus tua Lampsaci cst, qua-
’ “ que sylva Priape.
“ Nam lte praecipue in suis urbibus
“ colit ora

‘⁴ Hellespontia‚caeteris ostreosior oris.''

208. Libra dies, da] Here Vir-

gil exemplifies his precept relating to
Astronomy.

The time, which he mentions for
sowing barley, is from the autuinnal
equinox to the winter solstice. This
perhaps may seem strange to an Eng-
lish reader: it being our custom to
sow it in the spring. But it is cer-
tain that in warmer climates they
sow it at the latter end of the year:
whence it happens that their barley
harvest is considerably sooner than
their wheat harvest. Thus we find
in the book of Exudus, that the flax

and the barley were destroyed by the

hail, because the barley was in the
ear, and the flax was in seed, but
the wheat and the rye escaped‚ be-
cause they were not yet come up.

Dies] Amongst the ancient Ro-
mans tho genitive case of the fifth
‹leclension ended in es: thus dies was
the same with what we now write
diei. Sometimes it was written (lie.-
which all the editors receive in this
place. Ihave restored dies, on the
authority of A. Gellius, who says
that those, who saw Virgil's own ma-
nuscript, affirmed, that it was written
dies. ‘⁶ Q. Ennius in sexto decimo
‘⁶ annali dies scripsit pro diez· in hoc
“ versu:

“ Postrema longinqua dies colficcrie
‘⁴ oetas.

“ Ciceronem quoque affirmat Caesel-
“ lius in oratione, quam pro P. Sestio
‘⁶ fecit, dies scripsisse, pro diei, quod
‘⁶ ego impensa opera conquisitis vete-
“ ribus libris plusculis ita, ut Caesel-
“ lius ait scriptum inveni. Verba
“ sunt haec Marci Tullii: Equites
‘⁵ vero daturos illius dies poenaS. Quo
“ circa factum hercle est, ut facile iis
‘⁴ credam, qui scripserunt idiogra-
“ phum librum Virgilii se inspexisse3
“ in quo ita scriptum est:

“ Libra dies somnique pares ubi. fice-
“ rit horas.-

“ id est, Libra diez· somnique.''

209. Dividit] So I find it in both
the Arundelian manuscripts, and‘ in
HeinSius,
