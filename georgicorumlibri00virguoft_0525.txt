GEORG. LIB. IV.

Foedera, terque fragor stagnis auditus Avernis.

Illa ‚quis et me ,inquit, miseram, et te perdidit Orpheu?
Quis tantus furor? en iterum crudelia retro
Fata vocant, conditque natantia lumina somnus.
Jamque vale: feror ingenti circumdata nocte,
Invalidasque tibi tendens, heu! non tua, palmas,
Dixit, et ex oculis subito, ceu fumus in auras
Commixtus tenues, fugit diversa: neque illum 500
Prensantem nequicquam umbras, et multa volentem
Dicere praeterea, vidit: nec portitor Orci

Amplius objectam passus transire paludem.

Quid faceret? quo se rapta bis conjuge ferret?

What great madness was this ?
Lo. again the cruel Fates call

493. Fragor.] Servius understands
fragor to mean an exultation of the
shades at the return of Eurydice, and
quotes a passage of Lucan in con.
firmation of his opinion:

“ - — Gaudent a luce relictam
“ Eurydicen, iterum sperantes Or-
‘⁶ phea Manes.”

But I think fragor is not used for a
-sound of joy : at least I am sure
Virgil never uses it in that sense, but
for some great crash, or horrid noise.
I take it in this place to mean a dis-
mal sound given by the earth, or per-
haps a clap of thunder, to signify the
greatness of the missortune. Milton
has a. thought like this, on our first
parents tasting the forbidden fruit:

‘⁶ Earth felt the wound, and nature
‘⁶ from her scat

ί( Sighing thro' all her works gave
‘⁶ signs of woe
“That all was lost.'’

And again,

‘⁴ Earth trembled from her cntrails,
‘⁶ as again

‘⁶ Iu pangs, and nature gave asccond
‘⁶ groan.

‘⁶ Sky low’r'd, and mutt’ring thun-
“ der, some sad drops

Slagnis auditus Auernis] Pierius
found stagni est auditus Averni in the
Roman manuscript. It is the same
in one of Dr. Mead's. In the other,
and in one of the Arundelian copies
it is stagnis auditur Averni. In the
old Paris edition of 1494, and in
some others, it is stagnis auditus Α-
verni. In the old Nurcnberg edi.
tion it is stagnis (auditur Averne’s.

504. Rapta bis conjuga] Pierius
says it is bis rapta conjuge, in some of
the ancient manuscripts.

508. Strymonis.
