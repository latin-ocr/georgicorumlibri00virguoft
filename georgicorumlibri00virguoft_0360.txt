of wolves. This strongly expresses
the mettle of a headstrong horse, that
he cannot be governed by such se-
vere curbs, as we find used by the
Ancients. Itis here put in opposition
to mollibus capistris, mentioned be..
fore, by which perhaps is meant

what we call a anffie bit, as Dryden
translates it:

‘4 And then betimes in a soft snagffle
⁶⁶ wrought.''

Havingjust mentioned the strengthen-
ing of horses with rich rhod, the
Poet takes occasion to tell us that no.
thing preservcs the strength either of
horses or bulis so much as keeping
them from venery. Hence he slides
into a beautiful account of the violent
effects of lust on all the animated part
of the creation. Ile first begins with
hum, describes their fighting for the
female, and the various passions‚ with
which the vanquishcd buli is agitated.

Firmum] Pierius says it is servatii]
some ancient manuscripts: but that it

isfirmat in much the greater number.

211. Equorum] Columella ad-
vises, that the good horses should be
kept separate from the mares, except
at the time designed for covering:
‘⁶ Equos autem pretiosos reliquo tem..
‘⁶ pore anni removere oportet a foemi„
‘⁶ nis, ne aut cum volent, ineant, aut
⁶⁶ si id facere prohibeantur, cupidine

the same which Virgil has used, with
relation to bulls:

‘⁴ Atque ideo tauros procul, atque

“ Pascua. ⁷

⁶⁶ servant.'’ ’ ’

219. Sylva] Servius says that
some would read Sila, a mountain of
Lucania3 which alteration he justly·
thinks unnecessary.
