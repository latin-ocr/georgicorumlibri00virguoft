‘³ each shoot3 whereas most persons
“ cut them into lengths of about a
‘4 foot, and plant them all, which is
‘⁶ very wrougt for the upper parts
‘⁶ of the shoots are never so well ri-
‘⁶ pened as the lower part which was
“ produced early in the springg so
“ that isthey do take root, they never
‘f‘ make so good plantS, for the wood
“ of those cuttings being spungy and
“ soft, admits the moisture. too freely,
‘⁶ whereby the plants will be luxuriant
‘⁶ in growth, but never so fruitsul as
“ such whose wood is clo*- r and more
“ compact.”

300. Summa destringe ex arbore
plantas] So Ι read with Heinsius:
the common reading is summas (Ie-
fringe, Pierius says it is summas de-
stringe in some old manuscripts3 but
summa in the Roman, and other more
ancient copie-s. One of Dr. Mead's
manuscripts has summas (lestrange.-
the other,and the Cambridge copy have
summa defringe. The same reading
is in the Nurenberg, and several other
old editions.

Columella says the best cuttings are
those which are taken from the body-3
the next from the branchc253 and the
third from the top of the tree3 which
soonest take, and are most fruitful, but
soonest grow old: “ Optima habentur a
‘⁶ lumbis: secunda ab humeris: tertia
“ summa in vite lecta, quae celerrime
“ comprehendunt, et sunt feraciora‚
“ sed et quam celerrime senescunt.”

301. Tantus amor terrm] The
Poet seems by this expression to insi.

nuate that those shoots which grow
nearest the earth,contract such a liking
to it, that they take better in it.

Neu ferro loede retusa] In the
Bodleian manuscript it is neferro laede
retuso .· in the King’s itis ηειι ferro
laede vetusto: in one of Dr. Mead’s
it is neuferro lege recuso.

A blunt knife not only increase-s
the labour of the husbandman, but
also tears tlievines,and makes wounds
that are not so apt to heal, as Colu-
mella has observed: ‘⁶ Super caetera
“ illud etiam censemus, ut duris, te-
‘⁵ nuissimisque et acutissimis ferra..
‘⁴ mentis totum istud opus exequa-
ί( mur: obtusa enim, et hebes, et
‘⁴ mollis falx putatorem moratur,
“ eoque minus operis efficit, et plus
‘⁴ laboris affert vinitori. Nam sire
‘³ curvatur acies, quod accidit molli,
‘4 sire tardius penetrat, quod ew-nit
(ί in retuso et crasso ferramento, ma-
‘⁶ jore nisu est opus. Tum etiam
‘⁴ plagoe asperae, atque inaequales,
a: vites lacerant. Neque enim uno
‘⁴ sed saepius repetito ictu res transi.
‘⁴ gitur. Quo plerumque fit, ut quod
(ί praecidi debeat, perfringatur, et sic
‘⁶ vitis laniata, scabrataque putrescat
‘⁶ humoribus, nec plagae consanentur.
‘⁶ Quare magnopere monendusputator
‘⁵ est, ut prolixet aciem ferramenti, et
‘⁶ quantum possit, novaculae similem
“ reddat. “

302. Neve oleoe sylvestres insere
truncos] It seems by this passage,
as if it had boen a custom to plant
wild olii-es in the rineyards, for sup-

ports
