GEORG. LIB. II.

Expectant, et viva sua plantaria terra.

‘⁶ way, so that the layer may not be
‘⁴ hurt by the roots of the other.
‘¹⁵ Then leave four buds, to come to
“the bottom of the trench, and
‘⁶ strike roots: rub the buds off that
‘⁴ part which‘ joins to the mother, to
‘⁶ avoid superfluous shoots. Suffer
‘⁶ that part, which is to appear above
‘⁴ ground, not to have above two or
‘4 at most three buds. Rub off
(ί all the buds, except the four lowest,
‘⁶ from that part which is put into
‘⁶ the ground, that the vine may not
‘⁶ strike roots too near the surface. If
‘⁶ you propagate it in this manner, it
‘⁶ will quickly take root, and the third
‘⁵ year you may separate it from the
“ mother.” Pliny tells us that na-
ture first taught this method hythe
bramble3 the branches of which are
so slender that they sall to the ground,
and make layers of their own accord:
“ Eadem, natura et Propagines do..
‘⁶ cuit. Rubi namque curiati graci-
“ litate, et simul proceritate nimia,
“ defigunt rursus in terram capita,
‘⁶ iterumque nascuntur ex sese reple-
‘⁶ turi omnia ni resistat cultura, pror-
‘⁶ sus ut possint videri homines tcrrae
’ “ causa geniti. Ita pessima atque
‘⁶ execranda res, Propaginem tamen
‘⁴ docuit, atque radicem acquiri viri-
“ dem.'’ This method of planting
I take to be what Theophrastus means
Ἰ 1)γὲΕὲνῖ ἧῖοᾷαῖἑὶζλὲἔὲἷῑςί alim, &c.]
Here he plainly describes what we
pan cuttings. This is what Theo-

phrastus means by ἀπό uzu-»224 It is
cutting the young shoots of a tree,
and planting them into the ground3
whence virgil says they have no need
of a root. They are called in Latin
Surculi. Thus we find them called
by Varro: ‘⁵ Tertium genus Seminis
‘⁶ quod ex arbore per Szcrcztlos defer„
‘⁶ tur in terram, sicin humum demit.
‘⁶ titur, ut in quibusdam tamen sit vi-
‘4 dendum, ut eo tempore sit deplan-
‘4 tatum quo oportet.'’

He speaks of it justly as a wonder,
that olive-trees should strike roots
from dry pieces of the trunk. This
is mentioned by Theophrastus; τοῦ
ξύλου κατακοπέντας εἷς μικρά. This
sentence of Vin-gil has been frequently
understood to mean grafting: but of
this he speaks immediately after. La
Cerda says, that what the Poet here
speaks of was practised in Spain in his
time. They take the trunk of au
olive, says he, depr-ive it of it⁷s root
and branches, and ent it into several
pieces, which they put into the ground,
whence a root, and soon afterwards a -
tree is formed : “ Hunc sextum
