Appian mentions wolves running

where the verb ‘ululare is applied to
spectres. But that real wolves should

as a prodigy, by the ancients: tho’
not always accounted an ill omen.
Horace speaks os Jupiter's sending a
great deal of snow and hail on this
occasion, and affrighting the city with
his thunder and lightning:

“ Jam satis terris nivis, atque. dirae
“ Grandinis misit Pater: et rubente

Appian also mentions the temples and
statues of the gods being frequently

Virgil is generally thought to me⁸an
that comet which appeared sor seven
nights after Caesar's death. But he
speaks of several comets: wherefore
Ι rather believe he means some fier-y
meteors, which were seen about that
time. Ovid calls them torches:

‘⁴ Saepe faces visae mediis ardere sub
