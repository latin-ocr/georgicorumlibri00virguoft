GEORG. LIB. II.

At rabidae tigres absunt, et saeva leonum

Semina: nec miseros fallunt aconita legentes ε
Nec rapitimmensos orbes per humum, neque tanto
Squameus in spiram tractu se colligit anguis.
Adde tot egregias urbes, operumque laborem: 155

But there are no ravening ty-
gers, nor sslvage breed of lions ς
nor do :leonites deceive the un-
happy gatlierers. Nor does tlte
scaly serpent trail his immense
folds alc-ng the ground, nor
collect his length into so vast a
spire. Add to this so many
famous ciues, and stupendous
works: so many towns built
on the rocky cliffs:

Homer speaks of the Lybian sheep
breeding thrice in a year 2

Τρῖς γὰς τίκτει μῆλα τελεσφόξον εἷς ἐνιαυτόν :

which is impossible, if the sheep be
of the same species with those of Eu-
rope3 which go 150 days with young,
according to Pliny3 “ Gerunt par-
“ tum diebus cl.'’ Mr. B--— trans-
lates pecudes, kine:

“ Twice ev’ry year the ltine are great
“ wlth young.''

Varro mentions an apple-tree, which
bears twice: “ Malus bifera, ut in
“ agro Consentino.''

151. Rabidae.] In the Medicean,
and other ancient manuscripts, it is
rapidae, according to Pierius. ι

152. Nec miseros fallunt aconita
legentes] The Aconite or Wolfsbane
is apoisonous herb, which was found
in Heraclea Pontica. We have se-
veral sorts in our gardenS, one of
which is very common, under the
name of Monkshood. There are se-
veral cases of persons poisoned with

eating this herb, one of which was

communicated lately to the Royal
Society, by Mr. Eacon. See Phil.
Transact. N. 432. p. 287. Servius
affirms, that the Aconite grows in
Italy, and observes, that the Poet
does not deny it, but artfully insinu-
ates, that it is so well known to the
inhabitants, that they are in no dan-
ger of being deceived by it. Dry-
den⁵s translation seems to be accord·
ing to this interpretation:

“ Nor pois’nous Aconite is here pro·
‘² duc'd,

“ Or grows unknown, or is, when
‘⁴ known, refus’d.'’

I do not find however that this
poisonous plant is now found com·-
mon in Italy 2 or that it was deemed
aplant of that country by the An-
cients.

153. Nec rapit immensos, δῖα] He
does not deny that there are ser-
pents in Italy, but he says they are
not so large or so terrible as those of
other countries.

155. Laborem] In the King’s ma-
nuscript it is labores.

156. Congesta manu praeruptis op-
pida saris] This is generally un-
derstood to mean towns built on roclsy
clffs, as Ι have translated it. Thus
Grimoaldus paraphrases: “ Extant
“ oppida non pauca, hominum in-
“ dustriiS, et laboribus, in promon-

torus
