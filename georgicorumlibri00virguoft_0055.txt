GEORG. LIB. Ι. ‘29

Multum adeo, rastris glebas qui frangit inertes,
Vimineasque trahit crates, juvat arva: neque illum
Flava Ceres alto nequicquam spectat Olympo: 96
Et qui, proscisso quae suscitat aequore terga,

He :uso greatly helps the fietus,
who breaks the sluggish clotls
with harrows, and (lraws the
oster hurdles: nor does yellow
Ceres look ‹lo'wn upon him in
vain from high Olympus: and

other place he says; ⁴· Si vero adusti
‘⁶ frigore.'’

94. Multum αᾶεο, &ej In this
passage he recommends the breaking
of the clods small, which the writers
of agriculture call occatio. “ Oc-
“ care, id est comminuere, ne sit gle-
“ ba‚’' says Varro, “ Pulverationem
“ faciunt, quarn vocant rustici occa-
“ tionem, cum omnis gleba in vineis
·“ refringitur, et resolvitur in pulve-
‘⁴ rem‚” says Columella.

95. Vimineas crates] Dr. Trapp
translates rastris vakes, and crates
harrows:

“ Much too he helps his tilth‚ who
“ with the rake

‘⁴ Breaks the hard lumpish clods⁷ and
“ o'er them ‹lraws

‘¹ The osier harr0w.’'

Rostrum, hhink, always signifies α
harrow, in Virgil ; who describes it as
something very heavy‚ which by no
,means agrees with a ralre. ln this
very Georgick we find iniquo pondere
rastri, and gra-ethus rastris. Crates
cannot be harro-ms, which are too
solid to be made of osiers or twigs of
trees, as the hurdles are. Thus we
have arbuteoe crates, in this Georgick;
and crates salignas, in the severith
AEneid3 and in the eleventh‚

‘⁴ Crates et molle feretrum
“ Arbuteis texunt virgis, ct vimine

‘⁴ (ψει-[ιο.υ

 

The word is used sor any kind of
basket work3 whence virgil, in the
fourth Georgick‚ applies it to the
structure of a honey-cornb; crates
solvere favor-mn ,· aud the crates sa·
Iignoe, just quoted, are the basket
work of a shiel‹l; whence the Poet
figuratively uses it to express the
bones of the breast:

“ crudum

“ Transadigit costas et crates pectoris
‘² ensem.’¹

 

96. Γίατα Ceres] Ceres is called
yellow, from the colour of ripe
corn: thus we have in Homer ξανθὴ
Δημῖντηξ.

97. Ee qui, ἅς] “ Ruaeus-,” says
Mr. B—‚ ·‘ and after him Mr. Dry-
“ den, apply this passage to what.
‘⁶ goes before3 but virgil means it
only of what follows, namely‚ cross
“plouing. What the Poet speaks
‘⁴ of here retains the Roman name
‘⁶ to this day, in many parts of Eng-
“ land, and is called sowing upon tlte
*⁴ back, that is, sowing stiff ground
“ after once plowing. Now, says
“ Vlrgil‚ he that draws a harr0w‚ or
‘⁴ a hurdle, over his ground, before
‘⁶ he sows it, multum juvat (tr-cm sor
“ this fills up the chinks‚ which
‘⁶ otherwise would bury all the corn:
“ but then, says he, ceres always
“ looks loudly upon him wlzo plows his
“ ground cross again, and then exer-
