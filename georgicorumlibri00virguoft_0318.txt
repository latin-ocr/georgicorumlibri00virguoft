Plutarch also, in the
place just now cited gives us to un-
derstand that the colour in question
was like the beautiful redness of a
human sace: ‘0 γοῦν βασιλεὺς, ὥς
φῶσιν, droam-'2523 ἓιαφερᾶἣως ehu Περιπα-
Ἶητικέν qando-aqna» Νικόλαον ’γλυκὺν ἕνἾα

&dmm-1 ἓὲ τὸ πρίω-ωπον Evnomia-cosm
ἓρυθῆμαῖος, τὰς μεγίστας καὶ καλλίστας

Hence itappearsplainly that the colour
which the ancients called plzoeniceus,
01· spadix, was a bright red, but we do
not know that any horse-5 are exactly
of such a colour: tho' the ancients
might as well apply red to homes, as
we to deer. The colours which come
nearest to it seem to be the hay, the
chesmtt, and the sorrel. Perhaps all
these might be contained under the
same name, for the ancients do not
seem to have been s'o accuratam distin-
guishing such a. variety of colours‚
as the model-ns, Ι have translated
the word spadix, hay, in this place,
because it seems to approach to the
colour of the spadix, as the ancients
have described it, and because the
word hay seems to be derived from
βαιὴ, or βωλίον, which is sometimes also
used for a branch of a palm, as we
find in the twelfth chapter of St. John's

gospel: ’Ἐλαζον τὲι βαΐα. τῶν panim,
uxi ἓξῆλὲον εἷς ὑπάντησιν ἆυτῷ, καὶ {uga-
ζον, ‘nom-220. Bai'g and Βαλίον are in·-
terpreted by Hesychius ῥοιὲδός φοίνικος.

Glauca] 'she commentators are
not agreed about the interpretation
of this word. I do not well un.
det-stand what Servius means by
‘⁶ Glauci autem sunt felineis oculis,
ζ( id est quodam splendore perfusis.”
Surely he cannot think the Poetis
speaking of the colour ofa horse’s eye.
Grimoaldus puts rutili for glauci.
But rutilus is recl-{oned among the red
colours by Aulus Gellius: “ Fulvus
‘⁶ enim, et ssavus⁷ et rubidys, et phoe-
‘4 niceus, et rutilus, et luteus⁷ et
“ spadix appellationes sunt rufi colo.
‘⁶ ris, aut acuentes eum quasi incen-
“ dentes⁷ anteum colore viridimiscen-
‘⁶ tes, aut nigro infuscantes aut virenti
‘⁶ sensim albo illuminantes.’' And in-
deed our poet himself has added it
as an epithet to fire in the first
Georgick:

ί( Sin maculae incipient rutilo imm1s..
‘⁶ cerier igni.”

And in the eighth AEneid:

‘⁶ His informatum manibus, jam parte
‘⁶ polita

(ί Fulmen erat,
‘⁶ plurima caelo

‘⁴ Dejicit in terras, pars imperfecta

Δ “ manebat.
