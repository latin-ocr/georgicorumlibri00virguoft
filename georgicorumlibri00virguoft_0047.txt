NOTES.

us, that according to the Atheni-am,
Arcturus rises on the fifth of Sep-
tember, but, according to Caesar,
on the twelfth : “ vindemiator ΖΕ-
“ gypto nonis exoritur. Atticae
Ἰ “ Arcturus matutino, Sc sagitta, oc-
“ cidit mane. Quinto Idus Septem-
“ bris Caesari capella oritur vesperi.
“ Arcturus vero medius pridie idus,
“vehementissimo significatu terra
‘¹ marique per dies quinque.’' Co·-
lumella no doubt followed the Greek
calculation. This author gives the
same advice about plowing a poor
soil; and sor the same reason:
“ Graciles clivi non sunt aestatc
“ arandi, sed circa Septembres ca-
“ lendas3 quoniam si ante hoc tem-
“pus proscinditur, effoeta et sine
‘⁴ succo humus aestivo sole peruri-
“ tur, nullasque. virium reliquias ba-
“ bet. Itaque optime inter Calen-
“ das, et Idus Septembris aratur,
“ ac subinde iteratur, ut primis plu-
“viis aequinoctialibus conseri pos-
“ sit: neque in lira, sed sub sulco
“ talis ager seminandus est.”

“ Arcturus in the time of Colu-
“ mella and Pliny, rose with the sun
“at Athens, when the sun was in
“ 1‘225 of Virgo3 but at Rome three
“ days sooner, the sun being in 9]ἶ
“ of Virgo: the autumnal equinox

ground lie fallow, every other year3
or eise to change the grain.

Tonsas noralem] Noralis signifies,
according to Pliny, a ground that is
sown every other year: “Novale
“ est, quod alternis annis seritur.¹’
Varro says, it is one that has been
sown before it is renewed by a se-
cond plowing: “ Seges dicitur quod
“ aratum satum est3 arvum quod
“ aratum nec dun. satum cst: no-
“ valis uhi satum fuit ante, quam
“ secunda aratione renovetur.” It
is sometimes also used to express a
land that is new broken up. The
epithet tonsas being added to novales,
seems lo bring it to Varro's sensc3
if we must understand it to mean the
same with demessus, as it is generally
interpreted. But perhaps, the Poet
may mean by tonsas morales, new
broken up fields that had ldtely been
grazed by cattle. Our author uses
tondeo in this sense, at the beginning
of this Georgick:

“ Tondent dumetajuvenci.’'

And in the third AEneid:

“ —- - Equosin gramine vidi
“ Tondentes campum late.”

73. Mutato sidera] Pierius says
it is mutato semine in the Roman ma-
nuscript, which seems a plainer and
more intelligible reading, than mutato
