GEORG. ΠΒ. 1. 73

Hinc tempestates dubio praediscere caelo

Possumus: hinc messisque diem, tempusque serendi 3
Et quando infidum remis impellere marmor
Conveniat3 quando armatas deducere classes,
Aut tempestivam sylvis evertere pinum.

Nec frustra signorum obitus speculamur et ortus,

Temporibusque parem diversis quatuor annum.

Hence we are able: to foresee
storms in doubtful weather3
hence we know the time ot*
harvest and the season of sow-
ing3 and when it is proper to
cut the saithless sea with oars ;
when to draw out the armed
fleets, or to fell the pine-tree
in the woods in a proper sea-
son: nor is it in vain that
we observe the setting and ri<-
ing ofme signs, and the year
divided equally into four dif—
ferent scas-ons.

NOTES.

runner of the night. This is so low
an idea, that l cannot think it ever
entered into the mind of our Poct.

Drydcn has translated these words ;
or tehen to fell thesurzes. He must
certainly have meant firrs: for the

To conclude so sublime a picce of farte, otherwise called gome, and

poetry with the mention of lighting
caumes, would be a wretched anti-
climax. Surely Virgil still keeps
amongst the heavenly bodies, and as
Vesper is the first star that appearS‚
he describes him poetically‚ as light-
ing up the rest. In other places this
star is called IIesperus.

252. Hinc tempestaleS, δια] After
this beautiful description of the hea-
venS‚ the Poet adds an account of
the usefulness of this knowledge to
Husbandmen :

Praediscere.] Pierius says it is
proeclz’cere in the Roman manuscript,
buthe does not approve of it. La
Cerda however has admitted this
reading.

253. messisque diem] In some
copies it is mensisque diem ,· but the
best authority seems to be for messis.

ι256. Τεηῳεςίὶυαιη sylvis evertere
pinum] In several of the old ma-
nuscripts and printed editions we

find in sylvis; but theleaving out of of astronomical knowledge.

the preposition is more conformable
to the style of our Poet.

ahin, is a prickly'shrnb‚ which grows
commonly on our heathy grounds,
and bears no sort of resemblance to a.
Firr or Pinc. There is some pre-
tence for translating Pinus a Firr,
as Mr. B has done: because that
tree which we commonly kt'iow under
the name of the Scotch, Fe'rr is really
a species of Piae.

By tempestivmn the Poet means the
proper season for felling timber. This
season we are told by Cato is when
the seed Is ripe: ‘⁶ Robus‚ materies
‘⁶ item pro ridica, ubi solstitium fue-
ί( rit ad brumam semper tempestiva
‘⁴ est. Caetera materies quae semen
‘⁴ habet, curn semen maturum habet,
“ tum tempestiva est.‘' Dr. Trapp
has translated tempestivam, seasoned.

 

‘4 Or when in woods to fell the sea-
ὅ( soned Pine.''

But I believe we never use that epi-
thet sor timber, which is not yet cut
down.

257. Necfrzcstra, &c.] Here the
Poet urges still farther the usefulness
