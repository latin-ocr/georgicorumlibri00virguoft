The Poet’s account of the generation
of Bees is by no means ”consistent
with the doctrine of the modern Phi-
losophem, who assert with great
probability, that no animal⁷ nor
even plant, i‘s produced without a

concurrence of the two sexes.

How-

ever the doctrine of equivocal ge-
neration was so generally admitted
by the Ancients7 that it is no wonder

the Poet should assent to it.

We

find this opinion related by Aristode,
in his fifth book of the History of

Animals.

“ There are various opi-

nions‚” says the Philosophcr,

For some deny that they either
copulate or bring forth thtir
young, thinking that they gather
their produce. Nor are these
agreed about the flower from
which they gather them t but
some will have it to be from the
honey-wort, some from the reed,
and others from the olive3 which
last, in favour of their opinion,
urge that there are more swarms of
Bees in proportion as the olive-
trees are sruitful. Some are of

has almost translated the words of
Aristode. But he has added, that
the Bees certainly sit like heus, and
that the young Bee at its first ap-
pearance is a worm: ‘⁶ Quod cer-
