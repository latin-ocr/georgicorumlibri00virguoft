NOTES.

inhorruit, onlyin three other places
in all his works: in neither of which
he puts it for scm· or tremolia (ι. In
the thixd and fifth AEneids, he uscs it
to express a horrid dar] ness over-
spreading the sea in a storm:

‘⁶ —---- Caeruleus supia caput astitit

‘⁶ imber
ᾗ( Noctem hyememque ferens. etzn.

“ [corruet unda tenebrw

In the tenth sEneid he uses it to de*-
31¹3? a wild boar erecting his bri-

f< — — Postquam inter retia ventum

⁴ ‘⁶ est7‘

ξ( Substitit, intremuitque ferma, et ἰη-
“ horruit armos.⁷'

Thus I take it in this placeto signify
‘the bristllng of the boarded ears of
corn3 as Mr. B. ——- has translated
it:

ξ( Or when the harvest bri-elles into
‘⁶ ears.”

315. Lactewtia] The Bodleian
and one of Dr. Mcad’s manuscripts
have lactantia. Servius observes that
lactans signifies that which yields
milk, lactem that which receixts
ῙιΊίΙΙςι noniishnnnt.

'lhe meaning of the Poet. seems to
be that the sternis of Autmnn and

Spring have nothing extraordinary in
them, being usually expected in those
seasons. Therefore he chooses to en..
large upon those storms which he has
often seen even in the time of har-
vest : and describes the terrible effects
of them in a very poetica} manner.

317. Fragilz'jffln stringeret hordea
calma] Stringere signifies to gather
with the hand, as is observed in the
note on that word, ver. 305. Ser-
vius seems to take it in this sense.
But Rnaeus interprete, it to bz'ml:
‘⁶ Et jam ligaret hordea paleis fragi-
“ libus.” Most of our translators
implieitly follow this interpretation.
Dryden translates this verse ε

‘⁶ Ev’n while the reaper fills his
‘⁶ greedy hands,

‘⁴ And bimls the golden sheaves in
‘⁶ brittle hands.”

Thus he takes fragili culmo to mean
the band of the slzeaf. Ι rather be-
lieve the Poet means the stem or
straw of the growing barley by cul-
mus, and uses the epithet fragilis to
express it's ripeness3 as he addsstavis
to arvis in the soregoing verse, for
the same reason. Mr. B.---lcaves
out the brittle straw, and says only,

ζ( -·—- And now bound the graIn.’'

Dr. Trapp follows Dryden :

(ί - —- - And bound

‘⁶ llis sheaves with brittle strawix’ff’
