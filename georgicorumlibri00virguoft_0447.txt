NOTES.

“ Vasa autern, quibus recipiuntur,
‘⁴ perfricanda sunt citreagine, vel her-
“ bis suavibus, et conspergenda im-
“ bre mellis exigui.'’ And under
the title of June, he seems to men-
tion melissophyllum for much the same
purpose: ‘⁶ Ubi globos apium fre-
“ quenriores videris, uncta manu suc-
“ co melissophylli, vel apii reges re-
“ quiras.'’ Perhaps instead of apii
we should read apiastri, and then he
will agree with Columella, in making
melissophyllon and apiastrum differ-
ent· Itis notimprobablehoweverthat
he meant baum hy citreago, for, ac-
¹ cording to Matthi1›lus,tlie ltalians call
that plantcedronella, and according to
Caesalpinusce'lronella, from the affini-
ty between the smell of it, and that of
a citron. Pliny also has been cited
in contradiction to Varro, as making
a distinction between apiaslrum and
melissoplryllon, because he mentions
them both in the twelfth chapter of
the twenty-first book τ “ llarnm ergo
“ causa oportet serere thymum, (ψία-
“ strum, rosam, violas, lilium, cyti-
“ sum, sabam, ervilium, cunilam,
⁴‘ papaver, conyzam, casium, melilo-
“ tum, melissophyllum, corinthen.'‘

But it may be ohserved, that Pliny
more-than, once has mentioned the
same plant under different names,
one Greek, and the oilier Latin. For
as his work was acompilation, he
sometimes sets down what the Greek
authors have said under the Greek
name, and the account given by the
Latin authors under the Latin name,
though they are one and the same

plant. But with regard to the plant
now under consideration, he plainly
enough shews in other passages, that
melissophyllon and ape'aslrum are the
same. ln the eleventh chapter of
the twentieth book, he tells us that,
according to Hyginus, apiastrum and
melissoplzyllon are the same: ‘⁶ Api-
astrum Hyginus quidem melissophyl-
lon appellat;’' and in the ninth chap-
ter of the twenty-first book he says‘
expressly, that the Latin name of
melissoplzyllon is apiastrum: ‘⁶ Me-
‘⁶ lissophyllon, quod Apiastrum,
4‘ meliloton, quod sertulam Cam-
“ panamvocamus.‘' l do not remem-
ber that apicas-trum occurs any where
in this author, except in the passages
just now quoted. We may conclude
from what has been said, that apia-
strum was a name which the Romans
had formed in imitation os μελισσά-
φυλλω, both names signisying the
Bee-herh. May has translated it
nzillsoz'le, which is the English name
of millefolium or ιςιτινϊοτιη but this
cannot be the plant intended. Addi-
son also translatesit milsoil. Dryden
has used a word which Ι have not
seen elsewhere, mel-suist but it is a
very just translation of μελὶφυλλω.
Dr.Trapp has rightlyrendereditlmym.
Cerlnthoe ignobile grumam] The
name of this plant is derived from
κηρίον, a homey-coum, because the
ssower abounds with a sweet juicc,
like honey. La Cerda says we may
soe how this herl) delights the Boos,

the Philosophcr has there said does not
