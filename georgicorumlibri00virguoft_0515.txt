Hic nunc Emathiae portus patriamque revisit
Pallenen : hunc et nymphae veneramur, et ipse
Grandaevus Nereus: novit namque omnia vates,
Quae sint, quae fu‘erint, quae mox ventura trahantur.
Quippe ita Neptuno visum est: immania cujus
Armenta, et turpes pascit sub gurgite phocaS.

NOTES.

Bz'pedum equorum] These ficti-
tious sea-horses are supposed to re..
semble horses in their foreparts with
two legs, and to end in a tail like
fishes. Therefore Virgil cans them
both fishes and horses.

book I. ver. 489.

391. Pallenen.] Pallene isa pe-
ninsula of Macedon. Virgil makes
this the native country of Proteus,
though it has been already observed‚
Homer calls him an Egyptian. He
might perhaps be born in Macedon,
and then travel into Egypt3 for ac-
cording to Herodotus, he was an ob.
’ scure person in that country.

Veneramur.] It is venerantur in
the King’s and in one of the Arun-
delian manuscripts, and in the old
Paris edition of 1494.

Dr. Mead‘s manuscripts.
