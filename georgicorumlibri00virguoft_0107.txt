GEORG. Lm, l.

Aut pecori signum, aut numeros impressit acervis.
Exacuunt alii vallos, furcasque bicornes,
Atque Amerina parant lentae retinacula viti.
Nunc facilis rubea texatur fiscina-virga :

NOTES.

were anciently scooped out of trees.
Thus Virgil speaks of hollowed al-
ders, when he mentions the beginning
of navigation :

‘⁶ Tunc alnos primum ssuvii sensere
“ cavatas.’'

But I believe navigation was so sar
improved in Virgil's time, that the
Romans made no use of hollow trees
sor boats. Therefore I rather think
he meant troughs, which seem more
immediately to concern the farmer
than boats.

263. Pecori signum] The way
of mai-king the cattle was by burning
them 3 as we find in the third
Georgick:

“ Post partum cura in vitulos tradu-
“ citur omnis: ’

“ Continuoque notas, et nomina gen-
“ tis inm-zcnt.”

Numeros impressit acervis] I
take the Poetto mean numbering the
sack‘s of corn3 perhaps 'm order to
signify the quantity contained in each.
For I cannot understand howthe
heaps of corn can be said to be im-
printed with numbers. Dr. Trapp, in
his noteon this passage says: “ Saclcs,
“ or if you please Stacks. Acervis.
“ ’Tis uncertain whether he speaks
‘⁶ of corn threshed or uuam-ei-Jzed:
“ of Barns, or of G1·cmar2‘es.’'

’ 264.Exaczczmtalz'iz·allos‚] Servius

interprete vallos the banks and ditches
which are made round vineyards:
“ Fossas et muros de terra factos, et
“ glebiS, qui fiunt in circuitu cohor.
‘⁶ tium et vinearum.” He takes
evacuant to mean the cleaning of the
ditches, and repairing of the banks.
But this interpretation seems to be
greatly forced: and besides it is no
work sor wet wcathcr: nor is it pos-
sible to be done within doorS‚ which
virgil plainly expresses:

‘⁹‘ Frigidus agricolam si quando con.
‘⁶ tinet imber.”

Valle· certainly mean the stakes or
poles, which serve to prop the vines·

265.Amerinaretinacula] Ameria
is the name of a city in Italy where
the best willows were said to grow in
abundance. It is a sort of willow
with slender, red twigs, according to
Columella: ‘⁶ Nec refert cujus gene-
“ ris vimen seras, dum sit lentissi-
“ mum : putant tamen tria esse ge-
“ nera praecipue salicis, Graecae,
‘⁶ Grallicae⁷ Sabinae, quam plurimi
“ vocant Amerinam, Graeca flavi
“ coloriscst, Gallica obsoletipurpu-
“ rei, et tenuissimi viminis. Ame-
“ rina salix gracilem virgam, et ruti.
“ lam gerit.’'

266. Rubeavz‘rga] Rubiwas the
name of a city of Apulia. It is men.
