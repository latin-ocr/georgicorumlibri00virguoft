NOTES.

nerally read oleoeque, armentaque,
But Pierius informs us, that in the
Medicean and other ancient manu-
scripts que is left out after oleoe. 1
find it so in the King’s manuscript.
Heinsius also, and Masvicius follow
this reading.

146. Hinc albi Clitumne greges,
dra] Clitumnus is a river of Italy,
in which the victims were washc·‹l‚
to be rendered more pure3 for none,
but such as were. white, were. offered
to Jupiter Capitolinus.

In the. King’s manuscript it is tauri
instead of taurus.

149. Hic verassidumm alque alicnis
mensibus cestus] He describes the
temperate air of Italy, by saying it
enjoys a. perpetual spring, 3111150111-
mer warnith in such months, as make
winter in other countries. Mr. B—

· contends, that we. ought to read mes-

sibus, for mensibus. “ Ι do not wonder
“ (says 110) if none of the interpreters
“ have been able to make 5011500111118
“ line: but if we alter mensibus to
‘² messibus, it seems very intelligible.
“ Virgil had already enumerated 111
“ the praises of his country, 111011·
“ 00111, their wine, their olives, and
“their cattle, and what could be
“ more properly mentioned after
“ them, than their foreign grasses?
“ he very poetically' calls their ver-
“ dure perpetual spring, and 111011·
f‘ frequent han-ests continued summer.

“ The Medica, which he tal-:es such
“particular notice of in 1110 first
“ Georgick‚ is cut seven or eight
“ times a year in Italy. There is a
“ passage in Claudiam, which may
“ give some light to this in virgil:

“ Quod gelidi rubeant alicuo gramine
‘⁶ mense&

“ What Claudian calls alieno gra-
“ mine, Virgil expresses by aliena
‘² mess-e. What the former describes
“by menses qui rubent, the latter
‘⁶ paints in a finer manner by festas.
“ 'shut this passage. relatos to 1110,
“jbreign grasse-9, can hardly be dis-
“ puteal, sor another reason, because
“ otherwise virgil would have left
“ them out of his praises of Italy,
“ which would have been no incon·
“ siderable omission.” In pursuance
of this criticis-m, his translation of
this passage is

‘⁶ Here ererlasting spring ador-ns the
“ field,

‘'· Andjorcign harvest-5 constant sum-
‘¹ 11101· vield.’'

This is a bold alteration, and not
warranted by the authority of any
manuscript. Alienis mensibus significes
in unusual months; that is, 111 such
months, as· other countries do not
feel warnitli. Lucretius uses alienis

partibus
