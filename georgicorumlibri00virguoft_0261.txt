uncouth jests at those who pass by.
This seems to bear a great resem-
- blance to the original of tragedy7 as
mentioned by Ηοι366. Theseus uas
king of Athe1157and firstbro ight them

Hence they ale called leeseidce by
V irgil.

384. Unctos saluae per utres]
The utres were bags made of goats
skins, into which they put their wine,
as is now practised in the Levant.
These skins were blown up likeblad..
ders, and besmeared with oil. They
were set in the fields, and it was the
custom to dance upon them with one
leg, at the feasts of Bacchus. The
skins beingxciy slippery‚ the dancers
often fell dow n, which occasioned a
great laughter.

manuscript it is Ausonii et Tr oja.

389. Oscilla] The learned aze-di.
vided about the meaning 01⁰ the word
oscilla in this place. Some have re-
course to the following sable. Bac.
chus had taught Icarius, an Athe-
nian shepherd, the use of wine, which

he communicated to his neiglibours..
The country people, being exceed..
iugly delighted with this noble liquor,
drank of it to excess, and finding
themselves disordered, thought they

had been poisoned by Icarius, and ⁷
killed him. His dog returning home
to Erigone, the daughter ot Icarius,
conducted her to the dead body of
his master, on the sight of which she.
hanged herself. Soon after the Athe-
nians were vis eited with a great pesti..
leuce, and their young women run.
ning mad hanged themselves, On
consuiting the 013616 they were told,
that they must appease the manes of
Erigone. This they pmformed, by

tying ropes to th( branches of trees ·

and swinging on them, 35 if they were
hanged: and afterwards, many falling
down and hurting themselves, they
hung up little images instead of them.

these lmages·
