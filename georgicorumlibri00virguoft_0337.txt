“ diligentes dedita opera et de indus-
“ tria equus emaceraount.’' Thus
also May translates it:

“ These things observ’d7 at covering

Δ ‘⁶ time, they care

“ To make their stallion strongly fat
‘⁶ and faire,⁷’

And Dryden :

‘⁴ These things premis'd, when now
‘¹‘ the nuptiai time

“ Approaches for the stately steed

· But La Cerda contentis, that this
whole passage reiates to bulls aad
cotes, which‘ opinion he confirms by
the Poet’s mentioning the* asilus ancl
the caivessoon after. To me it ap-
pears that this precept relaxes to both
species», for, at ver. 49. where· Via-gil
begins his subject, he professes to
treat of homes and balloc-,ks together :

‘⁶ Seu quis, Olympiacae miratus
‘⁶ premia palmae, ’

‘⁶ Pascit equos, seu quis fortes ad
‘⁶ aratrajuvencos

“ Corpora praecipue matrum legam

He then proceeds to describe the ‘²

good qualities of a οων ;

(ζ

 

Optima torvae
‘· Forma bovis :”

And immediately afterwards subjoins
those osa horse:

“ Nec non et pecori est idem delectus

“ equino, ,

Tu modo quos in spem statues

‘4 submittere geum,

‘⁶ Praecipnum jam inde a teneris
‘³ impende laborem.'’

After his long description of the good
quaiities of a horse, he now comes to
consider the generation of these ani-
mals, and seems to me to blend both
species together. In the passage now
under consideration, the fatiguing
the semeles with running before co-
paisti0n7 and in the next passage,
the restraining them from leaping,
seems most applicable to mares3 and
the mention of the (falves, and the
acilus soon after, and the time as..
signed for their copulation evidently
belong to COWS.
