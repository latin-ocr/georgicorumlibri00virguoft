THE

PREFACE.

HUSBANDRY is not only the most ancient, but also
the most useful of all arts. This alone' is absolutely neces-
sary for the support of human life3 and without it other
pursuits would be in vain. The exercise therefore of this art
was justly accountecl most honourable by the Ancients.
Thus in the earliest ages ‘of the world, we find the greatest
heroes wielding the share as well as the sword, and the
fairest hands no more disdaining to hold a crook than a
sceptra The ancient Romans owed their glory and power
· to Husbandiy: and that famous Republick never flourished
so much, as when their greatest nien ploughed with their
own hands. Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus was found naked
at the plough-tall, when he was summoned to take upon
him the Dictatorship. And when he had settled the Com-
monweasth, the glorious old man returned to the tillage of
his small far-m, laden with the praises of the Roman people.
C. Fabricius and Curius Dentatu8‚ those glor-ious patterus
of temperance‚ who drove Pyrrhus out of Italy, and van-
quished the Samnites and SabineS, were as diligent in culti-e
vating their fields‚ as they were valiant aud successful in
war. But when the virtuous industry of this great people
gave way to luxury and effeminacy, the loss of their glory
attended on their neglectot= Husbandry‚ and by degrees they

fell a prey to barbarous nationis·
This art has not only exercised thc bodies of the greatest
heroes, but the pens also of the most celebrated writers of
Antiquity
