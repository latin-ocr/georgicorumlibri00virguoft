NOTES.

The erithace is that with which they
glue the honey-combs together, to
keep any air from coming in bc-
tween: “ Extra ostium alvei obtu-
“ rant omnia, qua ven-it inter favos
“ spiritus, quam ἔριθοίιιην appellant
‘⁴ Graeci. . . . -. Erithacen vocant,
“ quo favos extremos inter se con-
“ glutinant, quod estaiiudmellc, pro-
“ poli·” Itseems to be this erithace
therefore, which Virgil means under
the several appellations of carcasum,
florz’buS, and gluten.

39. Fuco etflorz‘bus] Theszcczzs
is properly a sort of sea-weed which
was anciently used in dying, and in
coloni-ing the faces oswomen. Hence
all kind os daubing obtained the name
ofsucus.

Bystoribus the Poet does not mean
strictly, that the Bees plaster their
hives with flowers‚ but with a gluti-
nons substance gathcred from flowers.

41. Phrygiae . . . pice . . . Idan]
Hence it appears, that it was not the
Cretan bnt the Phrygian Ida which
was famous for pitch trees.

43. Sub terrra] Pierius says it is
sub terram in some manuscripts, sub
terras in the Medicean. Ι find sub
terram in the King's manuscript,

audin an oldedition in quarto, printed

at Paris in 1494 ς sub terras in one
of the Arundelian manuscripts.

Fecere larena] The common read-
ing isfoclere: butit seems to be a tau-
tology to say fodere effossas latebris.
I chuse therefore to read fovere, with
the Medicean and King’s manuscripts.
The same reading is admitted also by
Heinsius and Masvicius.

44. Antra] Fulvius Ursinus says
it is (ιῖῑό in his ancient manuscript.
Pierius also says it is alvo in several
copies 3 but he prefers antro.

45. Ε lcevz'.] The common read-
ing is et : but Servius, Heinsius, and
Masvicius read e. It is e also in one
of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts, and in
most of the old editions.

Cubilz‘a.] It is cubicula in the
Bodleian manuscript.

Lima] Higinius‚ as heis quoted
by Columella, directs us to stop the
chinks with mud and cow-dung ε
“ Quicquid deinde rimarum est, aut
“ foraminum, luto et fimo bubulo
“ mistis illinemus extrinsecus, nec
“ nisi aditus quibus commeent re-
“ linquemus.”

46. Raras superinjice frondem]
Higinius also advises to cover the
hivcs with boughs and leaves, to de-

send them from cold and bad t{lutea-
er:
