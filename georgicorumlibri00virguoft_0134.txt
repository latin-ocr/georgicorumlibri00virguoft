to foresee unslrowery suns, and
fair open weathcr, and toknow
them by manifest signs. For
then the light of the stass does
not seem dim,

The spnttering of the lamps, being
occasioned by the moisture of the
air, may well predict rain.

signs of wind and rain, the Poet
now proceeds to give us those of fair
weathcr.

Erizam-es] So Pierius found it in
some ancient manuscripts. Almost
all the editions have er e‘mbri; taking
the Poet’s meaning to be that these
are signs of fair weather following
the shower3 or that they are to be
obsorva during the rain. May‘s
translation is,

This reading seems more poetical‚
than the common z and it is certain,
that Virgil's meaning could not be,
that these observations are to be made
during the rain. At such a time it
would be impossible to observ-s the
brighiness of the moon and stars;
which are the first prognosticks men-

tioned by our author.
