384. Se· tibi, &ej The Poet here
gives directior-s about taking care of
the wool: he observes, that prickly
places and fat pastures are ro be avoid..
es13 aud theu gives directions about
the choice of the sheep, and particu-
larly of the rams:

Sex] It is sit in the old Nurenberg
edition.

Aspera sylva] All prickly bushes
are injurious to sheep, by rending
their fine wool, and wounding their
fiesh, which he mentions soon after
amongst their diseases: ‘⁶ secuerunt
‘⁶ corpora vepresss’

385. Lappoeque stabulique] See
the note on book Ι. ver. 153.

Fuge pabula loeta] The wool is
thought not to be so good, if the
cattle are very sat. Columella men.
tions the hungry lands about Parma
and Modena, as seeding the most va-
luable sheep: ‘⁶ Nunc Gallicae pre-
‘⁶ tiosiores habentur, earumque prae..
‘⁶ cipue Altinates: item quae circa
‘⁶ Parmam et Mutinam macris stabu-
“ lantur campis.”

386. Continuo] See the note on
vor. 75.

Greges villis lege mollibus albos]
Varro mentions the softness of the
wool, as essential in a good sheep:
‘⁴ De forma, ovem esse oportet cor„
“ pore amplo, qum lana multa sit
‘⁶ et molli, villis altis et densis toto
Ξ( corpore, maxime circum cervicem

‘⁴ et collum, ventrem quoque ut
(ί habeat pilosum, itaque quae id non
‘⁶ habereut, majores nostri apicas ap.
⁴⁶ pellabant, et rejiciebant.” Colu-
mella says the whitest are most
esleemedg ‘4 Color albus cum sit op..
‘⁴ timUS, tum etiam est utilissimus,
‘⁶ quod ex eo plurimi fiunt, neque
‘⁶ hic ex ali0.” Palladius also ob.
serveS, that regard is to be had to the
softness of the wool: ‘⁶ Eligenda est
‘⁶ vasticorporis, et prolixi velleriS, ac
‘⁴ mollissimi, lanosi, et magni uteri.”
388. Nigra subest udo tantum cui
lz'nguapalato] Aristone affirms, that*
the lambs will be white, or black, 01=
red, according to the colour of the
veins under the tongue of the ram:
Λευκὲι δὲ τὰ ἔκγονα ’γίνεῚοιι καὶ με’..
λαινα, ἐὰν ὑπὸ τῇ τοῦ κριοῦ γλῶτΊῃ
λευκαὶ φλέςες εἶσιν ’ἢ μέλαιναι. λευ-
κὰ μὲν, ἐὰν λευκαὶ, μέλαινα. δὲ, ἐὰν
ἐὰν δὲ ἀμφότεραι, ἆμφὸ..
τερα. woffo} δὲ, ἐὰν ωυῤῥαιῖ. Varro
also, from whom Virgil took this ob-
servation, gives a cautiori to observe
if the tongue of a ram be black, or
speckled, because the lambs will be
of the same colour: ‘⁶ Animadver-
“tendum quoque linguane nigra,
4⁶ aut varia sit, quod fere qui ea ha„
‘⁴ bent, nigros aut varios, procreant
⁶⁶ agnoS.” Columella, who quotes
our Poet on this occasion, enlarges
on what he has said. He observes,
that it is not enough for the fleeceot'
aram

μέλαιναι.
