The Quincmm· liav- it’s name from the
numeral V : thret» troes being plant.
ed in that form are called the single
quincunx. 'l‘he double quincunx is
tlte V doubled, which makes an X,
being four trees planted in a square,
with a tit'th in tho centro. This
being often repeated forms the fol.
lowing figure z

Now as Vix-gil compares the disposi-
tion os the trees in a vineyard to an
army drawn up in battle array, it is
(widem, that he must mean the for.
mer figure : the latter not being pro-
per sor that purpose. The Romans
usually allowed three soot square
for every common soldier to manage
his arms, that is„ six foot between
each, which is a proper distance sor

the vines in Italy, according to Co-
lamella, who says the rows should
notbe wider than ten feet, nor nearer
than four: “ Sed de spatiis ordinum
‘⁶ eatenus praecipiendum habemus,
‘⁶ ut intelligant agricolae sive aratro
‘⁶ vineas culturi sunt, laxiora inter.
‘⁶ ordinia relinquenda, sive bidenti-
‘⁶ bns angustiora: sed neque spatio-
‘⁴ sima, quam decem pedum, neque
‘⁶ contractiora, qnam quatuor.'’
These distances may indeed agree
very well with the warmer climate of
Italy3 but, as Mr. Miller justly ob-
serves, the dampness os our autumns
requires our vines to be planted at
greater distanceS. He advises them to
be planted so, that there may beten
feet between each row, and six feet
in tlte rovrs, between each vine.

In unguem is 'allowed by all the
Commentators to be a metaphor taken
from the workers in marble, who
try the exactness of the joints with
their nails. lt signifies therefore per-
fectly or exactly.

Via signifies the spaces or paths
between the rows.

Limes is the cross path, which9
in the square figure, cuts the other
at right angles.

Ι take the order os the words to
be thus: nec secius via quadret sedo ,
limite, arboribus positis in unguem3
‘⁶ and no less let every path, or space
‘⁶ square with the cross path, the
‘⁶ trees being planted exactly.”
