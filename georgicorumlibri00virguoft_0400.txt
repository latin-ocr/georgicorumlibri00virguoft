381. Hyperborea] See the note
on ver. 196.

Septem subjecta triana] This Tme-
εἰς, as the Grammarians call it, or
division of septemtrio into two words,
is not infrequent. Thus Ovid:

‘⁴ Scythiam, septemque trio-
“ nem
‘⁶ Horriser invasit Boreas:

 

And

“ Gurgite caeruleo septem prohibete
“ triones:''

And

(Ε

 

Interque triones
‘⁶ Flexerat obliquo plaustrum temone
“ Bootes.”

Nay we often find triones without
septem. Thus our Poet in the first

and third AEneids:

‘⁶ Arcturum pluviasque Hyadas, ge-
“ minosque triones.”

Thus also Ovid:

“ Tum primum radiis gelidi caluere
⁴⁶ triones:

Interque triones

‘⁶ Flexerat obliquo plaustrum te.
“ mone Bootes„

The triones or septem triones are the
two northern conStellations‚ com-
monly known by the names of the
greater and lesser bear, in each of

which are seven stars placed nearly in
the same order, and which were
fancied by the Ancients to represent
a waggon, and were therefore called
ἅμαξαι and plaustra .· whence we al.
so call the seven stars in the rump
and tail of the great bear Clzarles's
waitz. AElius and Varro, as they
are quoted by Aulus Gellius, tell us
that triones is as it were terriones, and
was a name by which the old hus.
bandmen called a team of oxen:
‘⁶ Sed ego quidem cum L. AElio et
‘⁴ M. Varrone sentio, qui triones
“ rustico certo vocabulo boves ap-
‘⁶ pellatos scribunt, quasi quosdam
‘⁵ terrionem, hoc est arandae colen-
“ daeque terrae idoneos. Itaque hoc
“ sidus, quod a figura posituraque
“ ipsa, quia simile plaustri videtur,
‘⁶ antiqui Graecorum ἄμαξαν dixe.
‘⁶ runt, nostri quoque veteres a bu.
‘⁶ bus junctis septentriones appel.
‘⁶ larunt, id est, a septem stelin, ex
‘⁶ quibus quasijuncti triones figuran-
‘4 tur.” I believe that virgil, by
using trioni in the singular number,
and adding the epithet Hyperborw,
means the lesser bear, under which
are situated those who live within the
arctio circle. Dr. Trapp seems to
understand our Poet in this sense:

⁴⁴ Such is th' unbroken race of men
‘⁶ who live
‘⁶ Beneath the pole.”

Dryden has introduced the Dutch in
this place, and bestowed thewepithet
