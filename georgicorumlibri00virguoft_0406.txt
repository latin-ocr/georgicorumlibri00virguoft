NOTES.

And Horace ε

‘⁴ Simul domus alta Molossis
‘⁶ Personuit canibus.'’

 

Columella speaks of two sorts of (legs,
one to guard the house, and the other
to defend the solds. That which he
recommends for the house, seems to
be the mastiff, or molossus. lle says
it should be of the largest size, should
bark deep and lond, thathe may terrify
the thieves with his voice as well as
with his look, nay and sometimes
without being seen affright them
with a horrid growling: “Villae
‘⁶ custos eligendus est amplissimi cor-
“ poris, vasti latratus9 cancrique, ut
‘⁴ prius auditu maleficum, deinde
‘⁶ etiam conspectu terreat, et tamen
(ι nonnunquam ne visus quidem hor-
‘⁶ ribili fremitu suo fuget insidian-

408. [heroa] The Iberi have by
some been supposed to be a people of
that name who anciently (lwelt in
Pontus. But we sind in Pliny that
these Iberians were some of the peo-
ple, who settled in Spain: “ In uni-
‘⁶ versam Hispaniam M. Varro per-
‘⁴ venisse Iberos et Persas⁷ et Phoe-
‘4 nicas, Celtasque et Poenos tradiw
The same author soon aster informs
us, that all Spain was called »Iberia
from the river Iberus: “Iberus
‘⁶ amnis navigabili commercio dives,
‘f ortus in Cantabris haud procul

'amongst the Ancients.

‘4 oppido9 Juliobrica, ccccl. M. passa
(ί ssuens, navium per cclx. M. a Va„
ε( ria oppido capax, quem propter
‘⁶ universam Hispaniam Graeci ap-
‘⁶ pellavere Iberiam.’' The Iberus
is now called the Ebro‚ and has the
city of Sar-agossa on it’s banks. The
Spaniards were so famous for their
robberies, that the Poet makes use of
their name, in this place, for robbers
in general. It cannot be supposed,
that he means literally the Spaniards
themselves 3 sor those people were to‘o
far removed from Italy, to be able t'o
come by night to rob their sheep-folds.
La Cerda has taken much pains to
justify his country-men, by shewin‘g
that, it was anciently very glorious to
lire by rapine.

409. Timidosq It is tumidos in
one of the Arundelian manuscripts.

Onagros.] The Onager or wild ass
is an animal of Syria, frequent about
Aleppo and Apamia. The skin of it
is very hard, and is dressed into that
sort of knotty leather, which we call
chagrin. Varro says the wild asses
are very numerous in Phrygia and
Lycaonia, and are easily made tame:
‘⁶ Unum ferum, quos vocant Ona.
‘⁶ gros, in Phrygia et Lycaonia sunt
‘⁶ greges multi ......... Α d semina-
