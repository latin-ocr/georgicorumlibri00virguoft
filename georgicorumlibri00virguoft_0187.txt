“ Nor other home, nor other care

Mr. Pon.

Theophrastus describes this tree to
be something less than a pear-tree3
he says it's leaves are cut about the
edges, and like those of the llesc or
ever-green oak. He adds, that there
are several soi-ts of thern, differing
according to their fruit, which is ot'
the size of a bean, and grows thick
upon the branchos like inyrtle ber-

i'mv‘lov. φύλλον ειέὲέντομέις ἕχον καὶ πρι-
νῶἓες · · · · ‘ys‘uio δὲ ἆυῶοῧ πλείω ἓιειφορὲις

παράλληλα, πυκνὸς ἐπὶ τῶν fimas-33⁹. Pliny
has translated Theophrastus 'almost
word for word, with very little addi-
tion. He informs us however that it
was frequent in Italy, where it had
‹legeneratedz ‘⁴ Eadem Africa qua
“ vergit ad nos, insignem arborem
“ Loton gignit, quam vocant celtin,
⁴‘ et ipsam Italiae jimziliarem, sed
‘⁴‘ terra mutata1n.'’ It must indeed
have very much degenerated, is it be,
as most Botanists agree, that which
we call the nettle treet the fruit of
which is far from that delicacy‚ which
is ascribed to the Lotus of the an-
cients. The leaves are indeed cut
about the edges: but he must have a
warm imaginatum), who can find in
them any resemblance of the Iler.

Hence some Crities have taken the
liberty to alter the text os Theo-
phrastus, reading πριωνῶὲες instead of
πρινῶὂες, that is, serratal, or indented
like α saw, instead of like those (ff the
ilex. But, if we should allow this
emendation, it would not answer our
purpose: for, either ἐντομὲις ἔχου cut
about tlzc alges, and πριωνῶδες εενναίεᾱ,
mean the very same thing, and so
Theophrastus would be guilty of tau-
t‹›logy; or else the first must be in-
terpreted sinuatod, which is not true
of the nettle-trec. Resides, in Pliny’s
time, it certainly was waffiess for he
translates this passage: ‘⁶ Incisurae
“ folio crebriores, alioquin ilicis vi-
“ dei-entur.

It seems to ine more probable that
the Lotus of the Lotophagi is what wc
now call Zizgsphus or the quube-trce.
T'ne leaves ot' this are about an inch
and a half in length, and about one
inch in breaddu, of a shining green
colour, and serrated about the edges:
wheret'ore they are much more like
the leaves of the ilar, than those of
the nettle-tree can be imagined to be.
The fruits grow thick upon the
branchos, according to what Theo·
ph rastus says of the Λῶτος. They are
of the sinape and size of olives, and
the pulp ot' them has a sweet taste,
like honey, which agrees with what
Homer says of this tree; that it has ⁸
μελιηδέα καρπόν. They are sent over
dried, froin Italy.

There is another sort of Lotus
mentioned by 'l‘lieophrastus, different
from that of the Lotophagi, which he

calls
