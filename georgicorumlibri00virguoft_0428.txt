year 1714. This account was drawn
up by Mr. Bates, then Surgcon to
his Majesty's houshold, who was ap-
pointed, together with four Justices
of the Peace, by the Lords Justices,
to inquire into this disternper, and
by him communicated to the Royal
Society. Itis printed in the Philoso-
plzz'cal Trcmsactions, No. 358, p. 872.

This Gentleman observeS, that all
Cows have naturally a purgatiori by
tho Anas for five or six weeks in the
spring, from what the Cow-keepers
call thesrimness of the grass 3 during
which time they arc brisk and lively,
their milk becomes thinner, of a
blueish colour, sweeter to the taste,
andin greater plenty. But the spring
preceding this distemper, was unu-
sually dry all over Europe. Hence
there was but little grass, and that
so dry, and void of that frimness
which it has in other years, that Mr.
Batos could not hear of one Cow-
keepcr, who had obscrvcd his Cows
to have that purgation in the same
degree as usual: and very few who
had observed any at all. They all
agreed that their Cows had not given
above half so much milk that sum-
mer as they did in others 3 that some
of them were almost dry3 that the
milk they did give. was much thicker,
and yellower than in other years. It
was observed by the whole town,
that very little of the milk then sold
> would boil without turning; and it
is a known truth, that the weakest
ef the common purges dep‘rive a Cow

entirely of her milk3 from all which
circumstances he thinks it evident‚
that the want of that natural purga-
tion was the sole cause of this disease;
by producing those obstructions‚
which terminated in a putrefaction,
and made this distemper contagiouS.

The symptoms of this distemper
were, that they first refused their
food ; the next day they had huskish
coughS, and voided excrements like
clay ; their heads swelled, and some-
times their bodies. In a day or two
more, there was a great discharge of
a mncous matter by their nose, and
their breaths smelled offensively.
Lastly a severe purging, sometimes
bloody, which terminated in death.
Some Cows died in three days, and
others in five or six, but the bulis
lived eight or ten. During their
whole illneSS‚ they refused all man-
ner of sood, and were very hot.

Of sixteen Cows which he dissect-
ed, the five first had herded with those
that were ill, and the symptoms of
this distemper were just become visi·
ble; in these, the gall-bladders were
larger than usual, and filled with bile
of a natural taste and smell, but of a
greener colonr. Their sweet-breads
were shrivelled, and some of the
glandsobstructedandtumefied. Many
of the glands in their mesenteries
were twice or tlirice their natural
bigneSS. Their lungs were a little
inflamed, and their flesh felt hot. All
other parts of the bowels appeared
as in a healthsul state. The next six
that ho opencd, had been ill' about
