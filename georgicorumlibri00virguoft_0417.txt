NOTES.

‘⁶ suerit totus grex ejus contagione
‘⁶ corruptus.'’ Grimoaldus is ot'the
same opinion: ⁶⁶ Haec inquam signa
‘⁶ et indicia, quae febrim solent an-
‘⁶ tecedere, simul atque perer-peris,
‘⁶ crimen vitabis, in quod poteris in-
‘⁶ cidere, si dum uni parcis, fuerit
“totus grex ejus contagione cor-
‘⁶ ruptuS.'’ La Cerda gives the same
interpretation: ⁶⁶ Illud culpam ferro
‘⁶ compesce refertur ad eam culpam,
‘⁶ quae residebit in pastore, nisi utatur
‘⁶ ferro.²⁷ Ruaeus seems to think that
by culpam is meant the disease of the
sheep: ‘⁶ hujus morbum coerce sta-
‘⁶ tim ferr0.” ssut Virgil is not here
speaking of any partial disease, which
might be restrained by being cut out,
but ofa general disorder which spreads
itsels over the whole body, making
the sheep loath it's food, and lag
beavily behind the flock. Ι am per-
suaded therefore, that by culpam he
means the infected sheep, and byscr-

ἱ ro compesce, that it should be killed,

to prevent the contagion from spread-
ing. Thus in the second Georgick,
he uses ramos compesce, to express the
· pruning of trees, to hinder the too
luxuriant spreading os the branches:

ἐξ

 

Tum denique dura *-

‘⁶ Exerce imperia, et ramos compesce
⁶⁶ fluentes.'’

All the translators have concnrred
in understanding culpam compesce, to

'1³:1³ meant of killing the sheep. Thus
, ay:

‘⁶ straight kill that sheepe
‘⁶ Before th’ infectior! through th’
‘⁶ whole fiocke doe creepe.’'

 

And Dryden :

⁶⁶ Rei-enge the crime, and take the
‘⁶ traytor's head,

⁶⁶ E’er in the faultless ssock the, dire
‘³ contagion spread :’'

And Dr. Trapp:

‘⁶ Delay not, kill th’ insected3 e’er
‘⁶ thro’ all

‘⁶ Th’ unwary ssock the dire con.
‘⁶ tagion spread.’'

” 470. Non tam creber agens, &c.]
After these diseases, to which the
sheep are subject, our Poet adds that
the distempers of cattle are innumer-
able. Hence he takes occasion to
speak of a great plague, by which
all the country about the Alps was
laid waste.

‘⁶ T he words agens hyemenz,” says
Dr. Trapp, “are commonly explain-
‘² ed hy tempestatem serens. And
‘⁶ t'nen it should be rendered notin
But I rather
understand it, agens for agitans
‘⁶ hyemem, or aerem in hyeme, i, e.
“ procella. Surely a multitude of
⁶‘ whirlwinds ‹lo notprecede a storm3
‘⁶ but are themselves one, or at least
⁶⁶ parts of one.’‘ ’

Ι do not think that creber agens
hyemem turbo is to be understood to

mean

‘⁶ bul4 before a storm.
