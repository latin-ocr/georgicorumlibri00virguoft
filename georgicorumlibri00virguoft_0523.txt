GEORG. LIB. IV.

Et caligantem nigra formidine lucum

Ingressus, Manesque adiit, regemque tremendum,
Nesciaque humanis precibus mansuescere corda. 470
At cantu commotae Erebi de sedibus imis

Umbrae ibant tenues, simulachraqne luce carentum :
Quam multa in foliis avium se millia condunt,
Vesper ubi, aut hybernus agit de montibus imber :
Matres atque viri, defunctaque corpora vita
Riagnanimum heroum, pueri, innuptaeque puellae,
Impositique rogis juvenes ante ora parentum,
Quos circum limus niger, et deformis arundo
Cocyti, tardaque palus inamabilis unda

 

Alligat, et novies Styx interfusa co'e‘rcet.

Quin ipsae stupuere dOmuS, atque intima Lethi
Tartara, caeruleosque impiexae crinibus angues

 

Eumenides, tenuitque inhians tria Cerberus ora,
Atque Ixionii cantu rota constitit orbis.

NOTES.

469. Manem] This-word is used

for departed souis, for the places
where they dwen, and also for the
infernal deities.

471. Erebi] nebus, according
to Hesiod, was the son of Chaos3

sperono:

but according to some, itis the name
of the prosoundest mansion of hell.

472. Ibant] ln the Ring's manu-
script it is stant.

473. Foliis] The common read-
ing is sylvi53 but Pierius foundsoliz‘s
in all the ancient manuscripts. I
find soliis in one of the Arundeiian7
and in one of Dr. Mead⁷s manuscripts.
Heinsius also reads folliu

479. Cocyti] Cocytus and Styx
are rivers os hell.

480. Iimmabiletvj Some read in-
nabilis, as Ι find it in the King’s and
in one of Dr. Mcad⁷s manuscripts,

reading‚ and is generaily received.

481. Stupuere] It is obstupuere
in one of Dr. Mead's manuscripts.

482. Impleroe.] Pierius found am.
pleoeoe in the Lonibard and other ma-
nuscripts, and inneaeoe in the Roman.
It is amplexae in the King’s manu-
script, and in the old Nurenberg edi.
tion.

482. Canta] The usnai reading
is vento, which I do not find any of
the Commentators can make tolera-
ble sense. Servius says cum is under-
stood, and there-fore the meaning is,
that Ixion’s wheel stood still with it's
wind, that is, with the cause ofit's
volubiflity. Philargyriusthinksverzlo
is put for ventu, and that sor adventu,
