NOTES.

It is certain that furze is frequently
used as a sence, and the llowers are
sought after by the bees: but it is no
less certain that the farte was never
called genista by any ancient Latin
writer. See the note on lentaeque
genistoe, ver. 1⁶2.

Umbras] So I read with Heinsius.
Pierius says it is *umbras in all the an-
cient manuscripts. I find it so in all
those which I have collated. La Cerda,
Ruaeus, and several other editors hare
umbram.

437. Undcmtem buxo Cytorum]
Servius says Cytorus is a mountain of
Blacedonia: but, according to Pliny,
it belongs to Paphlagonia: ‘⁶ Ultra
‘⁶ quem gens Paphlagonia, quam Py.
‘⁶ laemeniam aliqui dixerunt, inclu-
(ί san] a tergo Galatia. Oppidum
‘⁶ Mastya Milesiorum, deinde Crom-
‘⁶ na. Quo loco Henetos adjicit
“ Nepos Cornelius, a quibus in
‘⁶ Italia ortos cognomines eorum
“ Venetos credi postulat. Sesamum
(ι oppidum, quod nunc Amastris.
‘⁶ sslons Cytorus, a Tio lxiii M. paSS.”
Rnaeus says it is a city and mountain
ns Galatia, on the borders of Pa-
phlagonia, Strabo indeed speaks of
a city os that name, but he places it
in Paphlagonia, and neither he, nor
Pliny, mention either atown ormoun-
tain of that name in their accounts

of Galatia. Cytorus was very fa.-

mous for box. Thus Theophrastus:
‘H ΣΞ ωὑξυςμεγέἓειμέν ἐ μεγάλη. τὸ 3⁸} φύλ-
λον ὅμοιον ἕχει μυῤῥᾷνῳ.φῦεται δ’ἔν τοῖς ψυ-
χροῖς τόποις καὶ τραχέσι. nez? ’γὰξ τὰ Κύ-

donia is cold, for it grows there also,
tho’ not very large, but the largest
and fairest trees of it are in Cyrene τ

γὰρ maffia nstvov‘laamakv ἐ μεγάλοι.μέγισ.
Ἴσι δὲ καὶ κάλλιςοι ἓν Κυρῆνῃ. Perhaps
Servius read this passage negligently,
and finding Macedonia mentioned,
put down Cytorus, as a mountain of
that country. Pliny says box grows
in great plenty on the Pyrenean hills,
and on CytoruS, and on'sserecynthus:
‘⁵ Buxus Pyrenaeis, a Cytoro mon..
‘⁶ tibus plurima, ac Berecynthio
‘⁶ tractu,” La Cerda thinks we
should read Cyrenoeis or Cyrenis, in
Pliny, instead of Pyrenaeis, accord,
ing to the last quotation from Theo-
phrastus. But Robert Constantine,
and other learned Criticks think
κυρνῖνῃ is an error in the copies of
Theophrastus, and that it should be
κυρνῳ, Corsica. It is certain, that.
Pliny uses Corsica, where the editions
of Theophrastus have κυςνῖνῃε “ Cras,
‘⁶ sissima in Corsica . . .. Haec in
‘⁴ Olympo Macedoniae gracilior, sed
‘4 brevis.” And besides it is not
probable, that Theophrastus, after
he had said the box ssourished most in
cold places, would say that'itfgrew
