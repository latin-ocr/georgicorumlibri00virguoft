537. Non lupus {midias 01])ἶο-
ras, &e.] The Poet having already
mentioned the. destruction which was
made among the cattle, now repre-
sents this wasting pestilence as ex-
tendingitself through 031111, sea, and
air: he observes that physic was of
no service, and that even 1110 divine
masters of the art sailed. To com-
plete the horror of this pestileuce, he
represents Tisiphone, one of the Fu-
ries spreadiug death and destruction
all armmd, the cattle falling by heaps,
their hides useless, and the wool
spreading the infection in those who
presumed to weavo it into garments.

Thucydides says, that: the pesti-
leuce, which hc describes, was more
dreadfid, than cau be expressed by
words, and was more grievous than
could be borne by human nature,
which shewed it plainly to be none
of the common sort of diseascs. For
even beasts and birds of prov, which
use to seed on human carcasseS‚ would
hardly touch the bodies of 111050,
who lay unburied, and if they tasted
them, they died themselves: Γενό-

The Poet here openly contradicts
Aristotle, who sayS‚ that a pestilen-
1131 disease does not: seem ever 10111-
