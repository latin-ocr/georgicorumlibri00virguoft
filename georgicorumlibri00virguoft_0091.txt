NOTES.

“ minorum morsum munitur vallo
“ aristarum.’' I shall add another
proof, that the triticum was bearded :
all the statues and medals of Ceres,
that ever Ι saW, have no other corn
represented on them than that which
is bearded.

ver. 73.

220. Aristan] Arista is the heard
of corn: “ Spica ea, quae mutilata.
‘⁴ non est, in ordeo et tritico, tria ha-
“ bet continentia, granum, glumam,
“ aristam: et etiam primitus cum
“ spica oritur‚» vaginam. Granum
“ dictum quod est intimum solidum:
‘⁴ gluma,qui est folliculus ejus: arista,
“ quae, ut acus tenuis, longa eminet
“ e gluma3 proinde ut grani theca
‘⁴ sit gluma, apex arista.
‘⁸ dicta quod arescit prima.’¹

By the epithet Eooe, Virgil does
not mean setting in tlte east, as some
have imagined, but in the morning,
at sun rising: that is, when the

Pleiades go down below our western
horizon, at the same time, that the
sun rises above our eastern horizon.
Hesiod, according to Pliny, com-
puted this to be at the autumnal equi-
nox: Thales, twenty-five days after,
Anaximander twenty-nine, and Euc-
temon forty-eight: “ Occasum maa
“ tutinum Vergiliarum Hesiodus,
“ nam hujus quoque nomine extat
“ Astrologia, tradidit fieri, cum ae·
“ quinoctium autumni conficeretur,
‘⁴ Thales xxv die ab aequinoctio,
‘⁶ Anaximander xxm, Euctemon
“ XLV111.'' Columella, in the se-
cond chapter of his eleventh book,
says they begin to set at sun-rising,
on the ‘21st of October: ‘⁴ Duode-
“ cirno Calendas Novembris solis ex-
“ ortu Vergiliae incipiunt occidere.''
In the eighth chapter of his second
book, he comments on this very
passage of virgil. He there says the
Pleiades set on the thirty-first day
after the autumnal equinox‚ which
happens on the twenty-third of Sep-
tember: wherefore the time. of sowing
wheat must be understood to be six
and forty days from the setting of the
Pleiades, which is before the twenty-
fourth of October, to the time of
the winter solstice. ‘⁶ Absconduntur
“ autem altero et trigesimo die post
‘⁴ autumnale aequinoctium, quod fere
‘⁶ conficitur nono calendas Octobris,
“ propter quod intelligi debet tritici
“ satio dierum sex, et quadraginta ab
“occasu vergiliarum, qui fit ante
