NOTES.

certain: perhaps it was the. Carduus
solstitialis, οι· Saint Barnaby's thistle,
which, according to Ray, is very fre-
quent and troublesome in the corn
fields in Italy, “ Monspelii in satis
‘⁸ nihil abundantius, nec minus fre-
“ quens in Italia, unde incremento
“ segetum aliquando officit, et mes-
“ sorum manus pedesque vulneratl’
The epithet segnis is generally inter-
preted inutilis, itgfoeczmdas: I have
ventured to translate it Iazy, with ΜΓ.
Β -. Ι believe Vix-gil called the
thistle lazy‚ because none but a lazy
husbandman would suffer so perni-
cious a weed to infest his corn. Ser-
vius interprets horreret, abundaret, ut
totum agrum impleret: 1 take it in
this place to signify to appear tem'hle
οι· horrid. Virgil uses it, in the ele—
venth AEneid, to express a serpent's
erecting his scales:

“ Saucius at serpens sinuosa volu-
“ mina versat,

“ Arrectisque horret squamis, et sibi-
“ lat ore

‘⁴ Arduus insurgen5.”

In the same book he applies it to the
scales of a breast—plate:

“ Jamque adeo Rutulum thorace in-
‘'· dutus ahenis
“ Horrebat* squamis.’'

In ihc seventh AEneid he applies it to
roc ·s:

“ —m—-n Tetrica: horrentes rupes.'’

In the mindi, to the spoils of a liont‘
“ ———-— Horremisque leonis
‘⁶ Exuvias?

In many places, he uses it to express
the terrible appearance of the spears

of an army. ln the sevcnth AEneid
we find,

‘6

 

—-Atraque late
“ Horrescit strictis seges ensibu·s.’'

ln the tenth,

“ Mille rapit densos acie atque ἠοῖ-
“ rentibus hastis.''

And

“ ——- Hom-emes Marte Latinos.”

And in the twelfth,

“ ——-· Strictisque seges mucronibus

‘⁴ horret
“ Fessreal’

Thus it may be used with great pro-2
priety to express a thistle, which ist
so horribly armed all over with strong
prickles,

152. Intereunt segetes] This tran-
sition to the present tense is very beaw
tiful.

153. L‹1ppoe..] Lappa seems to
hare been a general word, to express
such things as suck to the garments
os those that pass by. We use the·
