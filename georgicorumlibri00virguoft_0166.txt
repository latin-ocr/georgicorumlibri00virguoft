and not without reason, that φὶγος
and Escnlusaro the same plant. This
being supposed, it has· been imae-rimu
that Fagffus is only φῆγος expressed ἰ11
Roman characters7 and «o that Es-
culus is the same with Faeus. It is
very plain, from Pliny, that Fagrus
is the beech : “ Fagi glans nuclei si-
‘⁴ rums, triangula cute includitur.
“ Folium 1‘e1·ue,ac levissimum„ Po-
“ pulo simil‹=.’⁷ But it is no less
plain thar 111(ι Ε.ςεηί)1.9 isa sort of
oak3 for Pliny reclzons it amongst
those trees which bear acorus:
‘⁶ Glandm, (μεθ proprie intelligi..
‘ tur, ferunt Robur, Quercus, Es-
‘4 culus, Corvus, nex„ ‘lubere‘ Theo-
phrastus also makes the φῆγος to be a
species of oak. Thus the φῆγος and
Pagus are two different trees: the
first being a sort of Oak, aud the
other a beech. The Esaeulas as our
Poet describes it has largeleavcs3 for
that I take 10 be †he sense of maxima
frondet. Ovid also speaks of it7 as a
tree wit'h abundance of large leaves :

‘⁶ -- Esculea frondosus ab arbore ra,-
“ mus:

and

‘⁴ Frondibzcs Esculus altis.’‘

 

virgil speaks of it in another place
of this Georgick7 as a large, spread-
ing troo, wilh a very deep root. See,
ver. 291. Pliny says the acorn of
the Iis-culus is next in slze and good-
ness 10 that of {he Qnercns: ‘⁶ Glans
“ optima in Quercu atque grandissi-
“ ma, mox Esculo.’⁷ He says also
that it is not so common in Italy as
theQuercus: “ Quippe cum Robur,

‘⁶ Qum-cumque vulgo, nasci videa-
“ mus, sed Esculum non ubiquvst
Horace however seems to speak of it,
as common in Daunia ι

“ Quale portentum neque militaris
‘⁴ Daunia in latis alit Esculetis.”

The same Poet represents tho wood
of the Esczclus, as beia-g very‘hard:

⁴⁶ ——Nec rigida mollior Esculo.”

This tree was sacred to Jupiter, thus
Pliny: ‘⁶ Arborum genera numini.
‘² bus suis dicata perpetuo servantur,
‘⁶ ut Jovi Esculusss’ We find also
'in the same author, that the Romans
made flwh· civick crowns of it:
‘⁵ Civica iligna primo fuit, postea
‘⁶ magis placuitex Esculo Jovi sacra.
“ variatumque et cum Quercu est,
‘⁵ ac (lata ubique quae fuerat, custo-
‘⁶ dito tantum honore glanclls.’' Ῐ
think it not improbable that the
Esculus may be that sort of oak,
which is known in some parts of
England under the name -of the buy..

leaf, not so much sfnuated about the
alges, as that of the common oak.

In the common oak, the acorns grow
on long stalks, and the leaves have
