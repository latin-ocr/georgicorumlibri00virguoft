Nec salici, lotoque, neque Idaeis cyparissis:

NOTES.

precepts in the most agreeable man·

It grows in great plenty in the Nile,

ner. Thus virgil, after he had said where they make bread of the hcads
that walnuts are ingrasted on arbutos, of it. Prosper Alpinus, an author of

apples on planes, and beeches on
chesnuts, adorns the wild ash with
the fine blossoins of the pear: and
instead of barely telling us that oaks
may'be ingrafted on clins, he repre-
sents the swine crunching acorns un-
der elim, thau which nothing can be
more poetical. At the close os this
passage, he gives life and sense to his
ingrastcd trces; making them wonder
at the unknown leaves and fruits with
which they are loaded.

83. Praeterea genus, ᾇτ’] In this
passage the Poct just mentions, that
there are severa! species of trees, and
speaks of the infinite variety of fruits.

The ·two first lines of Drydeu’s
translation are intolerable:

“Of vegetable woods are various
“ kinds

“ And the same species are of sev'ral
“ minds.'’

Ulmis] Theophrastus speaks of two
sorts of clm: Pliny mentions four.

34. Salia-21] Pliny speaks of four
sorts of willow.

Loto] There is a trec, and also
an herb, called Lotus hythe ancients.
The herb is mentioned by Homer,

as being fed upon by the horses of
Achilles,

Λωτόν ἔρετῆὅμενοι ἔλεόθρεπἹόν τε σέλινον.

good credit, who travelled into Egypt,
assures us. that the Egyptian Lotus
does not at all differ from our great
white water lily. But it is the tree
vvhich Virgil here speaks os: and
which gave name to a people mention-
ed by Homer in his ninth· Odyssey:

Οἵ δ’ αἶψ’ δεχόμενοι μῖγεν ἀνδράσι Λωτοφά-
woman.

'ow' ἄρα Λωτοφάγοι μήδονθ’ ἑτάροισιν
’ὄλεθρον

ιΗμετέροις, ἄλλοί σφι δόσαν λωτοῖο vinosus.

Τ ὧν δ’ ὅς-ις λωτοῖο φάγοι μελιηδέα καρπὸν,

Οὖνί ἴτ’ ἀπαγγεῖλαι πάλιν ἔθελεν, ᾗδὲ
νέεσθαι·

Ἀλλ’ dra-ro& βούλοντο μετ, ἀνδράσι Λωτο-
φάγωσι

Λωτὸν ἓρεπἾὸμενοι μενέμεν, νᾶφου τε λαθέσ-

θαι.
