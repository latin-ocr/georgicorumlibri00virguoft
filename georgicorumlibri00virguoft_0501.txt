etymology, however7 is not very cer-
tain, since the learned Father him-
sels confessos in another place, that
Prasiane is derived from the name
of the inhabitants, who were called
Prasii: ‘⁴ Prasiane, a Prasiis, Indi
‘4 amnis accolis, quorum ditionis
‘⁶ fuit, nomen invenit.” As for
the imaginary tautology, it has been
observed already, that virgil does
not describe the same place [wit-03
but only distinguishes Egypt, by de-
scribing the two sides ol' the triangle,
within which it is contained.

Nigra aream] La (Jerda thinks
these words are a moos, that Vir-
gil did not mean Egypt, because the
soil of the Nileis ooze, and not saud.
But arena is frequently used for any
sort of soil 3 and besides it has been
observed by travellers of the best
credit, that the natural soil of Egypt
is sand.

292. Septem ‹liceum-it in orca]
The seven mouths of the Nile are
so very famous, and so frequently
spoken of, that it may seem unne-
cessary to say any thing here con-
cerning them. But as the sense of
this passage very much depends on
a right understanding of the form
os the lower Egypt, Ι shall follow
the description given of it by Strabo.
This famous Geographer observes,
that the Nile flows ‹lirectly north-
ward, from the borders of Ethi-
opia, till it comes to the Delta,
where being divided as from a vertex,
it makes a triangular figure: the

sides of the triangle are two chan-
ncls of the Nile, running down on
each side of it to the sea3 that on
the right hand to Pelusium, aud
that on the left to Canopus aud
Heraclium: and the base is the sea-
coast between Pelusium and Hera-
elium. Thus the island is encom-
passed by the sea, and two channe-is
of the Nile3 and is called Delta,
because it resembles the Greek letter

Α little afterwards he sets down the
names of the seven mouths of this
river: Μετςί δὲ σ’ἶόμοι τό Kama-
