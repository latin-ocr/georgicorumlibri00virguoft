and are piel-ced by the Ri-
pliaean east wind: and hate
their bodies covered witn the
yellow spoils of beans.

NOTES.

the least countenanced either by his.
tory, or the words of his author:

⁶⁶ Such are the cold Ryphean race,
⁶⁶ and such

‘⁶ The savage Scythiam, and zenzcar.
⁶⁶ like Dutck.”

382. Rz‘plzoeo tunditur eura] It'

has been already observed, that the
Riphaean hills are probably that great
ridge of mountains which divides
Lapland from the northern partos
Muscovy.

Why the Poet mentions the east
wind in this place, as blowing on the
Hyperboreans from the Riphaean
hills, seems not very clear. It has
already been observed, that those
people were supposed to dwell on the
north side of those hills, which was
imagined to be even beyond the rising
of the north wind. Strabo seems to
treat the Riphaean hills themselves
asasabulous invention: Διὰ δὲ τὶν
ἄγνοιαν τῶν τόπων τούτων, οἷ τὰ ‘Ps-
παῖὀι ὅρη, καὶ τοὺς ι’Υνιέρρὀρεῖους μυ-
ommim-14, λόγου ἦξῖωνται, Pliny
speaks of them asjoining to Taurus:
⁶⁶ Taurus mons ab Eois veniens lit-
‘⁶ toribus, Chelidonio promontorio
“ disterminat. Immensus ipse, et
⁶⁶ innumerarum gentium arbiter de'x-
‘⁶ tero latere septentrionalis, ubi
‘⁶ primum ab Indico mari exurgit,
“ laevo meridianus, et ad occasum
⁶⁶ tendens: mediamque distrahens
⁶⁶ Asiam, nisi opprimenti terras *oc-
ξι currerent maria. Resilit ergo ad

⁶⁶ septentriones, flexusque immensum
⁶⁶ iter quaerit, velut de industria re-
⁶⁶ rum natura subinde aequora op-
‘⁶ ponente, hinc Phoenicium, hinc
‘⁶ Ponticum, illinc Caspium et Hyr-
‘⁶ canium, *contraque Maeoticum
‘⁶ lacum. Torquetur itaque collisus
⁶⁶ inter haec claustra, et tamen victor,
⁶⁶ flexuosus evadit usque ad cognata
⁶⁶ Riphoeorzcm montium juga, nume-
⁶⁶ rosis nominibus et novis quacun-
‘⁶ que incedit insigniS.” And in
another place he says, ⁶⁶ Subjicitur
⁶⁶ Ponti regio Colchica, in qua juga
⁶⁶ Caucasi ad Riphaeos montes torquen-
‘⁶ tur, ut dictum est, altero latere in
⁶⁶ Euxinum et Maeotin devexa, altero
“ in Caspium et Hyrcanium mare.”

383. Ρεειιιίιινη fulvis velatur cor.
pora setis] I read velatur with Hein-
sius and Masvicius: the common
reading is velantur. Pierius says it
is velatur in the Roman manuscript,
and in another of great antiquity,
where η has been interlined by some
other hand.

Ovid mentions the Getae as being
clothed with skins:

⁶⁶ Hic mihi Cimmerio bis tertia du0
⁶⁶ citur aestas

‘⁶ Littore pellitos inter agenda
⁶⁶ Getas.”

Tacitus also, speaking of the norlt

thern people‚ says, ‘⁶ Gerunt et seq

⁶⁶ rarum pelles, proximi ripae negII-

‘⁶ genter, ulteriores exquisitius, ut

ξε quibus nullus per commercia cul,
