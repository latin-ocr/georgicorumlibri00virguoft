GEORG. LIB. ΙΙΙ. 359

Fermento atque acidis imitantur vitea sorbis. 380

and imitate the juice os the
grape with barin and sour ser-
vices.

N OTES.

yest: not of two sortS, as Dr. Trapp
translates this passage 3

’ ‘⁶ And beer and cyder quaff, instead
‘⁶ of wine.’'

Yest alone will not make any po.
table liquor. But let us see what the
Ancients did really mean by the
word fermentum. We shall find this
in Pliny, who plainly enough de.
scribes it to be what we call leaven ε

for he says it is made of dough, kept ‘⁶

till it grows sour: ⁶⁶ Nunc fermen-
‘⁶ tum fit ex ipsa farina quae subigi-
‘⁶ tur, prius quam addatur sal, ad
‘⁶ pultis modum decocta, et relicta
“ donec acescat.’² I must acknow-
ledge, that it is somewhat difficult
to conceive what sort of liquor could
be made of this leaven. Perhaps in-
stead of fermento, we ought to read
frumento, which will remove all the
difficulty. It is certain that not only
the northern people, but other na-
tions also used drink made of corn.
Thus Pliny ascribes this liquor to
the western people, and to the Egyp-
tians· ⁶⁶ Est et Occidentis populis
‘⁶ sua ebrietas, fruge madida: plu-
‘⁶ ribus modis per Gallias Hispanias-

⁶que nominibus aliis, sed ratione
‘⁶ eadem. Hispaniae jam et vetus-
‘⁶ tatem ferre ea genera docuerunt.
“ AEgyptus quoque e fruge sibi po-
⁶⁶ tus similes excogitavit· nullaque
“ in parte mundi cessat ebrietas. ’⁷
The same author tells us that various

liquors are made of corn, in Egypt,
Spain, and Gaul, under different
names: ‘⁶ Et frugum quidem haec
⁶⁶ sunt in usu medico. Ex iisdem
‘⁶ fiunt et potus, zythum in AEgyp=
⁶‘ to, caelia et caeria in Hispania,
‘⁶ cervisia in Gallia, aliisque pro-'
⁶‘ vinciis.'’ Tacitus, in his book
de moribus Germanorum, says ex-
pressly, that the common drink of
that people was made of corn, cor-
rupted into a resemblance of xvj-ne:
Potui humor ex hordeo aut sra-
mento, in quandam similitudinem
vini εοτῐιιρΐυις. ” Strabo mentions
drink being made of corn and honey
in Thule. Ποιξ οῖς δὲ σῖτος xxa
μέλι γῖγνεἾσω, καὶ το πόμα. ἐντεῦθεν
Εχέὗϊ.

As for the drink made of services,
I do not find it mentioned by any
Roman writer, except Palladius, who
speaks of it only by hearsay· . ‘⁶ Ex
⁶⁶ sorbis maturis, sicut ex pyris, vi-
‘⁶ num fieri traditur et acetum„
We find in the same author, that in
his time wiues were made of several
sorst offruit: ‘⁶ IIoc mense [Octobri]
“ omnia, {1¹¹ae locis suis leguntur, ex

‘pomis vina conficiese’ He men..
tions perry, or the wine made of pears,

(ί
ίί

,and describes the manner of making

it: ‘⁶ Vinum de pyris fit, si contusa,
⁶⁶ et sacco rarissimo condita ponde..
⁶‘ ribus comprimantur, aut prae10.'’
He speaks also of syder: ‘⁶ Vinum
⁶⁶ et acetum fit ex malis, sicut ex
‘⁶ pyris ante praeccpi.’'
