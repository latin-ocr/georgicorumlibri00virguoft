nine soz-ts of apples, as tho most cx-
collvnt: ⁸‘ Praeterea malorum genera
“ exquirenda maximescandi-(ina, ma-
“ tiana, orbiculata, semiana. pelu-
“ sinna, amerina, syrica. malimela,

nincsorts: but in tluse are incnnhd

we do not now call apples

AIcinoi sylvam] 'she gurdens of
Alcinous, 1n which wore grossos of
fruit trees, are colchi-aud in the se-
ventli Odyssvy.

88. Crustumiis, Syriisque pyris>v gra-
vibusque volemis] 'l'lie Crustumio,
or, as others call them, crustumino,
were rockoned tho. bost sort of poars.
Columella givvs tlwni the first place
in his catulo-«gum and Pliny says they
arc the best flamm-vd. ‘⁶ Cuneus au-
“ tem crustuminu gratissilna.'’ Whe-
ther thoy art· any sort of pcars now
known is uncertain: ΜΓ. 13——
translatns tiu-ni worden pears.

The Syrian penis arc called also
Tarentina, according 10 Columella.
Th‹›y are thought by some to be the
bcrgctmot.

Tho vnlemi are so called, quia vo-
lam manus impleant3 because they
fill the palm of the hand. Ruaeus
thinks tlwy are the bon* chretien‚ and
that those are mistakon, who con-
found thom with the libralia of Pli-
ny, which arethe pound pears. Dry·
den however differs from Ruaeus:

‘⁶ Unlike are bergamots and pounder
‘⁴ pcars.’'

And Mr. B

 

“ The samevariety the orchard bears,

“ In wal-den, bergamot, and poun-
“ der pears.’'

90. Illcthymnaeo] Methymna is
a city of Lesbos, an island of the
AEgean soa. ldmous sor good wine.

91. 'J'lmsiae vitem] Thasus is an·
other island of the same sea. The
Thasi-an wine is mentioned by Pliny,
as being in high 'esteem : “ In summa
‘⁶ gloria post Homerica illa, de qui-
“ bus supra diximus, fuere Thasium,
“ Clflurnquoff’

Mat-condes albae] It is disputcd
whether these vim-s arc so called from
Mareia, m· Mareotis, a lake near
Alexandria ; from Mareotis, a part of
Africa, called also Marmarica, and
now Barca3 οι· from Mareotiffidpart
of Epirus. Columella seems to be
of the latter opinion, for he calls them
Greek vines: ‘⁶ Nam quae Graecu-
“ 1ae vites sunt, ut Mareoticae, Tha-
“ siae, Psythiae‚ &cl' Athenaeus is
of the former opinion, and says
the best Mareotick or Alexandrian
wine is white. But Pliny expressly
says the Alexandrian grape is black.
