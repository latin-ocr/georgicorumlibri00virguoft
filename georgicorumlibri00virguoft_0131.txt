NOTES.

These lines of Varro are undoubtedly
hori-owed from Aratus 3 and the
prognosticks contained in them are in
the sanie order, as in the Greek Poet.
Virgil has varied them, and made
them more poetical.

A 377- Aut arguta lacus, &c.] Thus

ratus .·

“H λίμνην περὶ δηθὰ χελιδόνες ἀΐσσον-
ται,
sacrifi τύπτουσαι ὅντως siwia-{mv ῧὲωξ.

This line of Vin-gil is exactly the
same with one os Varro, quoted in
the preceding note.

378. Aut veterem in limo, ἃς]
It is generally read et veterent .· but
Pierius observed autin several ancient
manuscripts. I find aut in the Bod-
leian and in one of the Arundelian
manuscripts. WVe find this prognos-
tick also in Aratus :

Ἢ faa-[Mor δειλαὶ γενεαὶ, ἕδραισιν ἔνεικε,
Αὗτόθεν ἐξ ὕδατος, πατέμς βοόωσι ’γυ-
firm.

As to the srogs croalcz'ng· out their
ancient moun in the muel, the Poet
no doubt alludes to the story of the
Lycian countrymen being turned into
frogs by Latona: which is mentioned
by Ovid ε

ζ(

 

- Et nunc quoque turpes

‘⁶ Litibus exercent linguas: pulsoque
‘⁶ pudore,

(ί Quamvis sint sub aqua, sub aqua
‘⁶ maledicere tentant.’²

“ Vox quoque jam rauca est.’'

379. ,S'oepz'zes el tectis penetralibus,
&c.] Thus Aratus ε
Καὶ κοίλης {mm-meg ὅχῆς ἐξ ὤεα *ri-dr·
τοι
&io-ew a’vnte'yuoerro.

Soc also the last of the verses quoted
from Varro, in the note on ver. 375.

380. Et bibit ingens arcus] It
was a vulgar opinion amongst the
ancients, that thc- rainbow drew up
water with its horus. We find fre..
quent allusions amongst the Poets to
this erroneous opinion. I shall con-
tent myself with one quotation from
the Curculio of Plantu53 where, as
Lena, a drunken, crooked, old wo-
man, is taking a large draught of
wine, Palinurus saw, see how the
bow drinks l we shall certainly have
rain to day:

“ — Ecce autem bibit arcus!
‘⁴ pluet

‘⁶ Credo hercle hodie.”

 

Aratus mentions the rainbow appeari
