GEORG. LIB. Ι.

Verum, ubi tempestas, et caeli mobilis humor
Biutavere vias, et Jupiter uvidus austris

’ Densat erant quae rara inodO, et quae densa relaxat3
Vertuntur species animorum, et pectora motus 420
Nunc alios, alios dum nubila ventus agebat,

Concipiunt.

Et laetae pecudes, et ovantes gutture corvi.
Si vero solem ad rapidum, lunasque sequentes

Hinc ille avium concentus in agris,

but when the storin ancl move-
able moisture of the heaven
have changed their cour-ses,
and the air moist with snuth
winds condenses what jus t 1 e-
fore was rare, and iarifies what
was (lens ες the inrages of their
minds are changed, and tiu ir
bieasts now receive a disteicnt
impression, from that which
they had when the wind drove
away the clouds. Hence the
b3rds join in concert in the
fields, and the cattle rejrflee,
and the ravens exulting eroak.
But ifyon regard the rapid sun,
and the nioons which follow
in order;

ἕ( quibusfata superent3 ·’' alnon-led&
by which they smptus fulc. ituaeus
follow sSorvius: “prudentia qast> po-
“ tentior est fato. ’' May translates
it according to thesanieconstruction3
but with a sort of paraphrase z

‘⁴ I do not thinke that all these crea-
‘⁶ tures have

“More wisedome than the fates to
‘⁴ mankind gaveR'

Dryden's translation is scarce sense ε

“ Not that I think their breasts with
‘⁶ heav'nly souis

‘⁶ Inspir'd‚ as man, zello (lestiny con.
‘⁶ troals.”

Mr. B--proposes a new interpre-
tation, “ major prudentia in fat0‚”
or “in futuro;” and accordingly
translates this passage,

“ Not that I think the gods to them
“ dispense

‘⁶ Of things m sale a more discern-
‘⁴ mg sense. '’

Dr. Trapp' is of the same opinion.

‘⁴ Prudence greater than sm (as this
‘⁴ is generally rendered) is ssat non-
“ sense. 'sake it thus: 1 greater
“ knowledge [than vie have] in the

“fate of things.'' His translation

runs thus ε

‘⁶ Not that I think an ingeny divine

(ί To them is giv’n or presciencc of
‘² events

‘⁶ Insula superior.”

Grimoaldus seems to have found the
true sense. of this passage: that these
a-iimals have no particular instruction
from the gods, orsuperior knowledge

Heinsius: almost all the, editions have
Jupiter hmnidtcs. Masvicius reads,

that (lenset is the. true reading. lfind
denset in one of the Arundclian‚ and
in one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts.

4020. Pectora] Itis pcclore in the
Cambridgeq and in one of Dr. Mead’s
manuscripts. Pierius found pectore
in several ancient copies: he ob-
serves that in the Medicean manu-
script pectore is written in a different:
hand.
