NOTES.

267. Tamum] Itis tonsum in
the Bodleian, and in one of Dr. Mead's
manuscripts, and in several of the old
editions.

Gallae] The gall is an exere..
seence or nest of an insa-ct, formed
on the oaks in Italy, aster the same
manner that oak-apples are in Eng-
land. All parts of the oak, espe-
ciallythe galls are astringent, they are
very proper therefore for the purging‘,
to which Boes aresubject in the spring,
occasioned by their sending greedily
upon spurge aster their winter pe-
nury, according to Columella :
“ Maximus autem annuus earum
“ labor est initio veris, quo tithy-
‘⁶ malli floret frutex, et quo eameram
‘⁶ ulmi promunt: namque sicut no-
‘⁶ vis pomiS, ita his primitivis ssori-
“ bus illectae, avide vescuntur post
‘⁴ hybernam samem, nil alioquin ci.
‘⁶ tra satietatem, tali nocente cibo,
“ quo se cum affatim repleverint,
‘⁶ profluvio alvi, nisi celeriter suc-
“ curritur, intereunt: nam et tithy-
“ mallus majorum quoque animalium
“ ventrem solvit, et proprie ulmus
“ apium.”

Admiscere] In the King⁸s ma.
nuscript it is immiscere.

268. Arentesque] In one of Dr.
Mead’s manuscripts it is ardentmque,
which is manifestly wrong.

269. Psythz'oe passos de vite race-
mos] See the note on book ΙΙ. ver.
270. Cecropiumque thymum] See
the notes on ver. 112, and 177.
Grave olentia centaurea] Lu-
cretius has tristia centaurea. This
herb was so called from the Centaur-
Chiron, who was said to be thereby
enred of a wound accidentally in-
flicted by an arrow of Hercules, ac-
cording to Pliny: ‘² Centaurea cu.
‘⁴ ratus dicitur Chiron curn Hercu-
‘⁴ lis excepti hospitio pertractantiar.
‘⁴ ma, sagitta excidisset in pedem,
‘⁶ quare aliqui Chironion vocant.''
There are two sorts of centaury, the
greater and the less, which have no
other similitude, than in the bitter-
ness of their taste. The greater is
cultivated in gartlens, the less grows
wild in England in many placeS, and
is tbe best known.
271. Et ellamflos in pratiS, δια]
Ι think we may venture to affirm,
that the plant here described is the
After atticus, or purple Italian Star-
wort. But let us see how Virgirs
description agrees with the Aster at-
ticus. Ray says it is common in
the nncultivated vallies of Italy,
Sicny, and Narbonne. ‘³ Nascitur
