lectum instead of loel117723 as it is in
the. Roman manuscript: but I take
loez‘um to be the true reading. By
loetum legumen virgil intends to cx-
prees beans ; which were esteeined as
the principal sort of pulse. Thus
Pliny: “Sequitur natura legumi-
“ 1111111, inter quae maximus honos
‘⁶ fabis.’' The same author, quot-
ing this passage of Virgd, substituti-s
faba for legumen: “ Virgilius alter-
“ nis cessare arva suadet, et hoc, si
‘⁴ patiantur ruris spatia, utilissimum
“procul dubio cst. Quod si neget
‘⁶ conditio, far serendum unde lupi-
“ num, aut vicia, aut juba sublata
“sint‚ et quae terram faciant lte-
“ tiorem.'’ lle mentions beans also
in another place, as· fattening the
soil, instead of dung: “ Solum in
‘⁴ quo sata cst laetificat stercoris
“vice.’' Cato also, where lie is
speaking of what eni’ich the carth,
begins with lupinum, jbba, vicia.
Legumen is derived (ὶ legendo, be-
cause pulse are gathered by hand,
and not rcaped according to Varro:
“ Alii legumina, alii, ut Gallicani
‘⁶ quidam, legaria appellant, utraque
“dicta a legendo, quod ca non se-
ιι1311111111, sed vellendo leguntur.’·'
Pliny has almost the same words,
speaking of the legumina: “Qu-a:
“ velluntur e terra, nen subsecantur:
f‘ unde et legumina appellata, quia
“ita leguntur.’' The epithet quas-
sante seems not to have been well
understood by the. Commentators.
J,Th⁰y generally indeed agree with

Servum, in telling us that quassante
is used for quassata; but then they
proceed no fai-ther than to tell us,
that they suppose the Poet alludes to
the shaking of the pods with the
wind. l have never observed any
remarkable shaking in bean pods.
nor dot-s their lii-in adherence to the
stall< seem to admit of it. I rather
believe the Poet alludes to the nie-
thod used by the Romans, of shak-
ing the beans out of the podS. Pli-
ny just mentions it in his eighteenth
book, where he says silba metitur,
deinde concutitur. Columella lias giv-
en us a particular account of it. He
says the)v uutie, a few bundles ata
time, at the further end of the fioor,
and then three or four men kick
them forwaul, and strike them with
sticks or pitch-forks, and when they
are come the whole length of the
fluor, they gather the stalks into a
heap‚ and so the beans are shaken
out. “ Maxime ex leguminibus ca,
“ et sine jumentis teri, et sine vento
‘⁶ purgari expeditissime sic poterit.
“ Modicus fasciculorum numerus re-
“ solutus in extrema parte areae col-
‘⁶ locetur, quem per longissimum
“ ejus, mediumque. spatium tres vel
‘⁴ quatuor homines promoveant pe-
ιι«1111115, ἃ baculis furcillisve con-
‘·' tundant: deinde cum ad alteram
“ partem area) pervenerint, in acer-
“ vum culmos regerunt. Nam serni-
“ na excussa in arca jacebunt,> su-
“ perque ca paulatim eodem modo
“reliqui fasciculi excutientur. Ae
