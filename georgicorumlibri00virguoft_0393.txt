Just as when the fierce Roman
under arms takes his way un-
der aheaxy load, and pitches
his camp against an enemy
expected· But
q ite otherwise, where are
the Scythian nations, and the
water os Maeotis, and where

region was famous for the best dogs.
Thus in ver. 405. we have veloces
Spartoe catulos. Varro also men-
tiens the Laconian dogs in the first
place: ‘⁴ Item videndum utboni se-
“ minii sint: itaque a regionibus
“ appellantur Lacones, Epirotici,
“ Sallentini.’'

346. Non secus ac patriis, δῖα]
The Poet here compares the African
loaded with his arms and baggage
to a Roman soldier on an expedition.
We leam from Cicero, that the Ro.
mans carried not only their shields,
swords, and helmets, but also provi.
sion for above hal-f a month, uten-
sils, and stakes : “ Nostri exercitus
‘⁴ primurn unde nomen habeant,
‘⁶ vides: deinde qui labor, quantus
“ agminis: ferre plus dimidiati men-
“ sis cibaria: ferre, si quid ad usum

, “ velint: ferre vallum: nam scutum,

i

“ gladium, galeam, in onere nostri
‘⁶ milites non plus numerant, quam
‘² humeros, lacertos, manus.

347. [musta] It is used for very

ζ great: as iniquo pondere rastri, and ,

labor improbus urget.

Hosti] Some read hostem.

348. Agmine] Pierius tells us,
that Arusianus Messus reads ordine.

349. Ac non qua Scythice, δια]
From Africa, the Poet passes to Scy.

thia, and describes the manners of
the northern shepherds, The de-
scription of winter, in these cold cliu
mates, has been justly admired as one
of the finest pieces of Poetry extant.

Scythice gentes] The Ancients call-
ed all the northern nations Scy.
thians.

Maeotiaque unda] So I read with
Heinsius and Masvicius. The com..
mon reading is ssIoeotz‘caque unda.
Pierius says it is stloeotz'a in the Ro.
man, the Medicean, and most of the
ancient manuscripts. I find Maeotia
in the Cambridge and Bodleian ma.
nuscriptS.

The lake Maeotis, or sea of Azof,
lies beyond the Black Sea, and re.
ceives the waters of the Tanais, now
called Don, a river of Muscovy.

350. Ister] He seems to mean
Thrace and the adjoiuing countries3
for it is only the lower part of the
Danube, that the Ancients called
Ister; as was observed in the note on
ver. 497. of the second Georgick.

351. Quaque redit medium Rho.
(Iope porrecta sub axem] ‘4 Rhodope
“ is a mountain of Thrace, which
“ is extended eastward, and is there
“joined with Iloemus3 then* part-
‘⁶ ing from it, it returns to the north.
