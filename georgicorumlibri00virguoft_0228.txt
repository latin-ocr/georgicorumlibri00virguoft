“coronamenta folio venere melo-

“ tin-on, spireon, trigonom cucuron,
⁵⁴ quod ccl-siam Hyginus v‹›c:1t‚” This
therefore is the casia, which he men-
tions a little afterwards, in thr· twelfth
chapter of the ninth book, as good
for bees: “ Verum hortis corona-
“ mentisque maxime alvearia et apes
“ conveniunt, res praecipui quaestus

apiastrum, rosam, violas, lilium,
“cyfisum, fabam, ervilitiin, cuni-
“lam, papaver, conyzam, casiam,
‘⁶ meliloton), melissophyllum, ce-
rinthen.'' ln the twenty-first chap-
ter of the thirteenth book he tells
us, that the leymclaea, which bears
the granum Gtiz'climn, is called also
cneorum,- and describes it to have
leaves like the wild olive, but nar·
rower, and of a guminy taste: “ Et
“ in quo nascitur granum Gnidiam,
“ quod aliqui linum vocant3 fruti-
“ cem vero thmveloeam, alii chame-
“ laeam, alii pyros achnen, alii
‘⁴ cnestron, alii cneoron. Est similis
²‘ oleastro, foliis angustioribus, gum-
⁸‘ mosis, si mordeantur, myrti marg-
“ nitudine, semine, colore, et specie
“ farris, ad medicinae tanturn usum.”
Dioscorides, in his chapter about
Thssnelaecz, tells us expressly that
the leaves of that plant, uhich, he
says also, bears granum gnirlium, are
peculiarly called cneoron: Ἐκ ταύτης
ὃ avidam,- κὸκκος nup-zris ὢν συλλέγεται.
τὰ δὲ φύλλα &weg leiim καλεῖται

all of thymcloea, and seems not to
have known the plant which affords
the granum gnidium. But in the se-
cond chapter of his sixth book he
mentions two sorts of cncorou, black
ami white3 the white one, he says,
has leaves something like an olive;
which agrees with what Pliny has
said of the thymeloea. Therefore it
is scarce to be doubted, that the
white cneoron of Theophrastus is the
same plant with the thymelaea of
Pliny and Dioscorides, and conse-
quently the cncormz, which, accord-
ing to Pliny, was called casia: and
hence we may conclude that the herb
Casia of virgil is the cucuron, οι·
thymelaa, which bears the granum
gnidium. The plant from which we
have the grana gnidiu, or cnidia, is
the Thymelaea lim· folii C. B. and is
called by Gerard sparge flam, or
mountain melote-mik,- and grows in
rough mountains, and uncultivated
placffi, in the wax-mer climate—53 and
may therefore very well be taken for
Virgil's Cana. The Germans have
their grana cnidia from the Mezereon,
which is a species of Thymeloea. Ι
have not seen the Thymelaea in any of
our gardens.
