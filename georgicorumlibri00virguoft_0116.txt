309. Balearis] The Balearides
are two islands near Spain, now
known by the names of Majorca and
Riinorca. The inhabitants of these
islanrls are said to have been famous
for slinging: their name being de-
rived from finimur.

311. Quid tempestates autumni,
osta] The Poet having barely men-
tioned the stormy seasons: the latter
end of spring, and the beginning of
autumn, proceeds to an elegant de-
scription of a storm in the time of
harvest.

Mead’s manuscripts has
