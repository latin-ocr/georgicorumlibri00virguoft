“ scriptitios clves in caeium receptos
‘⁶ putant.’' Ovid mentions sEneas
as being made one of these Indigetes,
by Venus, vrith the consent of Jupi-
ter:

‘⁴ Lustratum genitrix divino corpus
‘⁶ odore

‘⁶ Unxit‚ et ambrosia cum dulci nec-
‘⁶ tare mista

‘⁶ Contigit os3 fecitque Deum: quem
‘⁶ turba Quirini

“ Nuncupat Indigetem, temploque
‘⁶ arisque recepit.

Livy also says that AEneas was called
Juliiter Inslz'ges: “Situs est, quem-
‘4 cunque eum dici jus fasque est, su-
‘⁶ per Numicium flumen, ιῙουθηι In-
‘⁶ digetem appellant.”

Hence it appears to me that Vir-gil
invokes two orders of godS‚ the Dii
patrii, gods of the country, tutelary
gods, or Penates, and the Indigetes,
or deified men: and then that he

enumerates one of the chief of each
order. For we find that Vesta is a
principat tutelary goddess of Rome3
and Romulus is one of the chief of
the Indigetes, being the founder of
the city.

499. Tuscum Tiberim] The Ty-
ber is so called, because it rises in
Etruria.

Romana palatim] It was on the
Palatine hill that Romulus laid the
foundation of Rome. Here he kept
his court, asdid also Augustus Caesar:
hence the word Palatium came to sig-
nify a royal seat or paiace.

500. Juvenem] He means Au-
gustus Caesar, who was then a young
man, being about twenty-seven years
of age, when Virgil began his Geor-
giem, which he is said to have finish-
ed in seven years. But Mr. B————
and Dr. Trapp seem not very exact,
who call him a youth in their transla-
tions.

502. Laomedonteae lecimus per.
juria Trojoe] Laomedon King of Troy,
when he was building a wall round
his city, hired the assistance of Nep-
tune and Apollo, and afterwards de-
frauded them of the reward he had
promised.
