then prune the boughs. Be-
fore this they cannot bear the

severe dominion over them,
and restrain the luxuriant
branclies. Hedges also are to
be woven, and all sorts of
cattle to be restrained; espe-

NOTES.

‘⁴ runt: et quod maxime nocet, dum
‘⁴ omnia timent, nihil conantur.
‘⁶ Quod etiam rusticis notum est, qui
‘⁶ frondibus teneris non putant adhi-
‘4 bendum esse falcem, quia reformi-
“ dare ferrum videntur, et cicatricem
‘⁶ nondum patiposse.''

Uncls- carpenda> manibus frondem]
Bv uncis manibus, croolced hands, the
’ Pbet means nipping the tender shoots
with the thumb and finger, which is
practised in summer time, before the
shoots are grown woody and hard.

367. Stirpibus] In one of Dr.
Mead’s manuscripts it is viribus,
which reading Fulvius Ursinus observ-
,ed also· in the old Colotian manuscript.
' 370. Ramos compesce fluentes]
Pierius says it is ramos· compe-§ce τα-
lentes inv the most ancient Roman
manuscript3 and thinks both the
precept and exprvssion are taken
from the following passage of Varro:
“ Vites pampinari, sad a sciente:
‘⁶ nam id, quam putare majusg ne,
“ quein arbusto, sed in vinca fieri,
“ Pampiuare est ex sarmento coles,
‘⁶ qui nati sunt, de iis, qui plurimum
‘⁶ valent, primum ac secundum,
‘⁶ nonnunquam etiam tertium relin-
“ quere, reliquos decerpere, ne re-
‘⁶ lictis colibus sarmentum nequeat
‘⁶ ministrare succum.''

371. Texendae sepes, &c.] Here

the Poet speaks of making hedges,
to keep out cattle, and especially
goats, whence he takes occasion to
digress into an account of the sa-
critices to Bacchus.

*In one of the Arundelian manu.
scripts it is et Jam pecus omne timen-
dum. In the Bodleian it is etiam
et pecus omne tuendum. Pierius says
it is tuendum in the Roman manu-
script. {utens and most of the
editors have est after tenendum.
Pierius says est is wanting in the
Medicean copy. It is left out in all
the manuscripts I have collated, and
by Heinsius, La cerda, Masvicius,
and several othei-S.

This expression of wearing ahedge
does not seem to mean a green hedge,
but a fonce made of stakes, iuter-
ποῖοι] with dry sticks,

373. Super indignas hyemes]
Grimoaldus and Ruaeus interpret
super, practer.- in this sense Dr.
Trapp has translated it:

(ὃ

 

 

Resides storms,
⁶² And the sun's heat, the bufalos
‘⁶ and goats,

‘2 And sheep, and greedy heisers,

‘⁵ hurt thy vines,⁷‘

La Corda iuterprets it, that cattle
do more ha rm to the vineyards, than

heat aud cold: ‘4 Etiamsi hyemes in.

f< dignae‚‘
