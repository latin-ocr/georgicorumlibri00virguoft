Servius, Heinsius, and several of the
old editors also leave it out. It is
retained in the Bodleian, and in tho
other Arundelian manuscript. It is
more agreeable to the style of virgil,
to leave out the preposition.

Other authors differ from Virgil
in this particular, and propose other
days of the inoon's age, as equally or
more certain prognosticks of the en..
sning weather. The Poet follows
