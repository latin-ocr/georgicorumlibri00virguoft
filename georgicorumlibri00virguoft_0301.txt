with slow windings‚ and co-
vers the banks with tendet

for crowns in all the gameS, as we
find-in the fourth question of the
eighth book of Plutarch’s Symposi-
acks: where he inquires why the sa..
cred games had each their peculiar
crown, but the palm was common
to all.

In the King's manuscript it is Pri.

plumque tenebit] It was the custom
to place the statue of that god, to
whom the temple was dedicated, in
the middle of it. The other statues,
which he mentions, are to adorn the
temple.

In the Cambridge, and in one of
the Arundelian manuscripts it is illic
instead ofillz‘. Pierius found the same
reading in the Roman, Medic-ean,
- and other very ancient manuscripts.
He says that in the Lombard manu.
script the c has been erased, which he
greatly condemns. Ile interprets illic
to mean Mantua: ί(ἰίίίε, hoc est
‘⁴ Mantuae, in patria mea, quo pri-

‘⁶ mus ego Musas ab Aonia dedux-'

‘⁴ er0.” He thinks however that
illi may be put for illic, as iu the se-
cond AEneid: Illi mea tristia facta:
which the ancient Grammarians have

withstanding the opinion of these an-
cient Grammarians, I cannot but
think that eren in that passage of
the AEneid illi signifies not there, but
to him. Priamus hadjust reproached
PyrrhuS, as being of a less generous
temper than his father Achilles: to
which Pyrrhus replies: ‘⁶ Then you
‘⁶ shall go on this errand to my fa-
‘⁵ ther Achilles; and be sure you tell
‘⁶ him of my sad actions, and how
‘⁴ Pyrrhus degenerates from him:

‘4 Referes ergo haec, et nuncius
‘⁵ ibis

‘4 Pelidae genitori: illi mea tristia
‘⁶ facta,

‘⁶ Degeneremque Neoptolemum nar.
‘⁶ rare mement0.”

 

Surely illi relates to Achilles, tell
him os my sud actions, not tell there
my sad actions, for no place has been
mentioned.

Tyrio conspectus in ostra] Those
who offered sacrifice, amongst the
Romans, on account of any victory,
were clothed in the Tyrian colour.
Itis not certain what colour this was.
Some call it purple and others scarlet.
Perhaps it was a deep crimson3 sor
human blood is commonly called pur.
