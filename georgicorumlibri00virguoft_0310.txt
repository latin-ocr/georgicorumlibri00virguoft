NOTES.

1116 5011 of Laomedon, and elder
brother of Priamus, that is meant.
I must own it seems something strange
that he should choose to mention Ti-
thonus, from whom Augustus was not
descended, when Anchises or Assa-
racus would have stood as well in
the verse. I believe the true reason
of this choice was, that Tithonus was
the most famous of all the Dardan
family. It is said that Aurora fell
in love with this Tithonus, and
carried him in her chariot into AEthi-
opia, where she had Memnon by him.
As for the short space of time between
the ages of Tithonus and Augustus, it
may be observed that the Poet does not
say as many years as Caesar is distant
from Tithonus, but as many years as
Coesar is distant from tlte first origin
of Tithonus, that is, from Jupiter,
the author of the Dardan mee, which
is going as far back as the Poet well
could. ’

4⁰2. Seu quis, &c.] Here the Poet
enters upon the subject of this book3
and in the first place describes 1116
marks of a good cow.

Olympiaca-1 palmea] The Olympio
games were thought the most honour..
able ε and the victors carried palms in
their hands, which was esteemed the
noblest trophy of their victory. Thus
Horace:

“ Sunt quos curriculo pulverem Ο.
“ lympicum

‘⁶ Collegisse juvat, metaque fervidis

‘⁶ Eritata rotis, palmaque nobilis.'{

50. Pascit equos] The ancients
were exceedingly curious in breeding
1101565 for the Olympio games: and
it was thought a great commendation
to excel in that skill.

51. Optima torvoe forma bovz's.]
Pliny says they are not to be despised
sor having an unsightly look. ‘⁶ Non
‘² degeneres existimandi etiam minus
‘⁶ laudato aspectu :'’ and Columella
says the strongest cattle for 111110111-
are unsightly: ‘⁴ Apenninus durissi-
“ mos, omnemque difficultatem tole..
‘⁶ rantes, nec ab aspectu decoros:”

52. Turpe caput] Fulvius Ursi.
nus observes that Homer has used
ἀναιδέσι for great. Servius says turpe
signifies great. Grimoaidus also in.
terprets it magnum et grande caput.
May translates turpe caput also great
head. Ruaeus interprets it deforme
propter magnitudinem. Dryden has
sour heccded; and Dr. Trapp,

 

 

(ί Her head unshap’d and

‘4 large.’'

The prose writers recommend the.
largeness of a cow's forehead. Thus
Varro: latis frontibus: and Colu-
mella: srontz'bus latissimis.- and Pal-
ladius: alta fronte, oculis nigris et
grandibus.

Plurima cervix] Plurima signi.
fies much or plentiful, that is, in this
place, long and large. See the note
on plurima, ver. 187· of the first
Georgick. 'Varro says cervicibus
crassis uc longis. ·
