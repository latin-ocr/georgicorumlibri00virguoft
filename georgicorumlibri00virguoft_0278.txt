462. Μαηε salutantum] It was
the custom amongst the Romans,
sor the clients to attend the lewes of
their patrous.

Totis] [n the King's manuscript
it is notis.

Voluit] Pierius says, that in the
Medicoan manuscript it is vomat,
which he thinks sounds more elo-
gantly.

463. Testmline] Some think that
*testudine is here used sor an arch sup-
ported by the pillarS, or the shell of
a door. But Ι rather believe it al-
-ludes to that custom of the rich Ro-
man570f covering their bed-posts and

Tyriam purple, which was obtained
froin a sort of shell-fish. Tyre was
in Coele Syria. The Poet seems to
use Assyria sors-yria.
