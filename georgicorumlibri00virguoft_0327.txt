find the golrlen, szcrjft-footecl horses of

besides, standing by his chariot:

And at the latter end of the same

Mars into his chariot, after Hercules
had wounded him, and whipping the

which reading is received also by
Heinsius and Masvicius. Homer ce-
lebrates Xanthus and Balius, the
horses of Achilles, as immortal, and
makes them born of the Harpy Po-
darge, by the west wind:

lyra was the mistress of saturn, who,
to avoid being discovered by his wiso

.Ops, coming upon them unexpect-

edly, turned himself into a fine
horse. The consequence of this
amour was, that Philyra was delivered
of Chiron, half a man and half a

horse.
