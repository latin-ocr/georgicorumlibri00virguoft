NOTES.

196. Urentes culta capellas] We
find in Varro that the ancient Ro-
mans, when they let a farm, were
accustomed to make an article, that
the tenant should not breed kids,
because they destroy the trees and
bushes by browsing upon thern: “ Nec
“ multo aliter tuendum hoc pecus in
“ pastu, atque ovillum, quod tamen
“ habet sua propria quaedam, quod
“ potius sylvestribus saltibus delec-
“ tantur, quam pratis. Studiose enim
‘⁶ de agrestibus fruticibus pascuntur,
“ atque in locis cultis virgulta car-
“ punt: itaque a carpendo caprae
“ nominatae. Ob hoc in lege loca-
“ tionis fundi excipi solet, ne colonus
‘⁴ capra natum in fundo pascat: ha-
“ rum enim dentes inimici sationis.’'
This injurious biting of goats is also
taken notice of by Mr. Evelyn : “ Be
“ sure to cut off such tender branches
“ to the quick‚ which you find have
‘⁴ been cropt by goats or any other
“ cattle, who leave a drivel where
‘⁴ they bite; which not only infects
“ the branches, but sometimes en-
“ dangers the whole; the reason is,
“ sor that the natural sap's recourse
“ to the stem communicatos the ve-
“ nom to all the rest, as the whole
“ mass and habit of animal blood is
“ by a gangreen‚ or venereal taint.'’

197. Tarenti] Tarentum is a city
of Magna Graecia, part of the king-

dom of N apleS, famous for fine wool,

according to Pliny: “ Lana antem
“ laudatissima Apula, et quae in Ita-
“ lia Graeci pecoris appellatur, alibi
“ Italica. Circa Tarentum Ca-
“ nusiumque summam nobilitatem
‘⁴ habent.⁷’

198. Aut qualem infelix amisit
Mantua campum-J “ This line of
Mr. May's‚

 

“ Such fields as hapless M‘antua Ιιαε
“ ost,

“ has something very fine in it. The
‘⁴ metre is extremely grave and so-
“ lemn, as it is remarkably so in the
“ original. There the verse com-
“ plains, and every word seems to
“ sigh.'' Mr. B——,

Augustus Caesar had given the
fields about Mantua and Cremona to
his soldiers : and virgil lost his farm
with the rest of his neighbours; but
he was afterwards restored to the
possession of it, by the interest of his
patron Maeceria53 which is the sub-
ject of the first eclogue.

199. Herbosoflmnine] In one of

, Dr. Mead’s manuscripts, and in seve-

ral of the old printed copies it is ller-
boso in flumine.

200. Deerunc] So 1 read with
Heinsius, and Masvicius. In the
other editions it is desunt: but the
other verbs in this sentence are in the
future tense.
