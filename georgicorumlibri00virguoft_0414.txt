Vivaque sulphura-J So servius and
111051 of the Commentators agree 111111
it should be read. ΜΝΞ-«1510111111 et
sulphura viva in the Roman, Medi-
cean, and L 0111111111 1111111156111115. I
find the same reading 111 the lxing' ,S’
the Cambridge, 111( Bodleian and' 111
both the Arundelian manuscripts. lt
is ac sulphura viva in one of Dr.
Mead’s manuscripts, and in several of

’16 oldest printed editions.

Sulphur is without doubt a good
ingredient in this composition.

Ιίείίυίιονοειμιε graves] There are
two kinds of Hellebore, 1116 black end
1116 white. l take 11 to be 1116 while
Hellebore5 that virgil means. Co-
lumella„ expressly mentions 1116 white
Hellebore, as we have seen already in
1116 quolalion from {hat author, in
1116 note on ver. 448. Dioscorides
however ascribes the power of cur-
ing this sort of diseascs to 1116 black

while Hellebore is known to be
serviceable in diseases of 1116 skin, if
it be externally applied3 bnt it is too
rough to be taken inwardly‚ astho
black sort is. Hence perhaps Vix-gil
added 1116 69111161 graves, to express
the white Hellebore.

Bis-umen] Bitzcmen, or, as 1116
Greeks called 11, Asphalttcs, is a fat,
sulphureous‚ tenaceous3 inflammable
substance, issuing out of the earth or*
floating upon water, as at Pitchford

brought hither under ‘the name of

hardened into a substance like pitch.
