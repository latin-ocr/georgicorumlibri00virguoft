184- Omnibus una quies, δια]
This passage is taken from Aristotlc,
who says, that in the morning they are
all silent, till one of them calls the rest
up with two or three hums: then
they all go out to work. And when
they return, they are at first tumul-
tuons, but grow more quiet by (le-
grees, till at last one flies buzzing
round the rest, as isit commanded
silence, upon which they are all im-
mediately quiet: ’'OfOpwu δὲ σιωπῶ-
