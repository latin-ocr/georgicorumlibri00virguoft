at whose command the earth
being struck with thy mighty
trident, first brought forth the

NOTES.

gods, In this sense Dr. Trapp has
translated it:

“ —-Tl1‹r›u‚ at whose command,
“ The parcnt earth a Spl'iglltly stced
‘⁶ disclos’d.'’

3. Tellus prima may signify the sva-
shore, where the horse was produced
by Neptune3 forVirgil in another
place uses prima lewa in this sense :

<t

—-— Primaque vetant consistere

“ lerra.''

4. 'le Poct may allude to Attica,
the seat of this sablo, tor the Athe-
nians pretended to be the 1110111111-
cient ,people in the world. I have
ventured lo take it in what seems to
me the most obvious sense. I inia-
ginc that the adjectixe is put here
only for the adverb, of which many
examples may be produced from our
l‘oet: as “ pede terram» crebra se-
“ rit-’² Nay‚ he has used prima in
the same manner, in this very Geor-

gick:

“ Prima Ceres ferro mortales vertere

emendation is mentioned also by
Servius, who says lhe, most ancient
manuscripts have aquam. La Cerda’s
reasons are3 1. Herodotus says, that
in the temple of Erectheus, there
was an olive-tree and the sea, in
memory of the contention between
Neptune and Minerva. 2. Varro,
when be relates this fable, mentions
water, not a horse, to be produced
by Neptune. 3. In the best and
purest manuscripts of ovid, he finds

fretum, where tho common editions

have ferum :

‘⁶ Stare Deum pelagi, longoque scrire
‘⁶ tridente

“ Aspera saxa facil, medioque e vui-
‘⁶ nere saxi

Ι have adher-ed to the common read-
ing. sor tho three following reasons:
1. Because 1 do not remember to
have seen aquam in any manuscript,

seems proper for Vin-gil to imoke
Neptune, on account of his bestow-
ing the horso on mankind, that ani—
mal being celebrated in the third
Georgick3 whereas the sea has no-
thing to do in this Poeni. 3. Be-
