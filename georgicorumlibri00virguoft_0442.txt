NOTES.

and grows wild all over Europe, is
probably that which Pliny calls the
wild, and Dioscorides the gardeu
serpyllum. The plant very much
rcsembles thyme both in appearance
und smell, and is certainly proper to
be planted near Bees.

31. Graviter spirantis copia thym-
bram] The thymbra ofthe Ancients
is generally thought to be some
species of.›·atureia, or savoury. To
this opinion however it is objected,
that Columella mentions thymbra
and satureia as two different planis τ
‘⁶ Eademque regio foecunda sit fruti.
‘4 cis exigui, et maxime thymi, aut
‘⁶ origani, tum etiam thymbra, vel
‘⁶ nostratis cunilae, quam satureiam
‘⁶ rustici vocant ....... Saporis
‘⁶ 'praecipui mella reddit thymus.
(ί Thymo deinde proxima thymbra,
‘⁴ serpyllumque, et origanum. Ter-
“ tiae notae, sed adhuc generosae,
‘⁶ marinus ros, et nostras cunila,
‘⁴ quam dixi satlcrez'am.'’ He makes
them also different in his poem on the
culture of Gardeus:

‘⁴ Et satureia thymi referens, thym-
“ braeque sapore1n.''

Thus thymbra and satureia, according
to this author, are different, and sa-
tureia is the same with what he calls
cunila nostras. But in his eleventh
book he mentions a foreign sort of
cunila, transmarina cunila, which
perhaps may be the same with the

thymbra. I believe cunila was the
common Latin name for what the
Greeks called thymbra, and that the
cunila nostras or satureia was our
winter savozcrys, and the cunila trans-
marina, sor which they also retained
the Greek name thymbra, was the
thymbra Groeca J. B. which is call..
ed. also thymbra legitima by Clusius.
This last plantis said to be still called
thymbra, tlzrybi, and tribi, hythe Cre-
tans, in whose country it grows.
The former grows wild in Italy.
Both of them have a strong aromatic
smell, like thyme. ,

32. Violarz'a.] This word signifies
places set with violets.

33. Ipsa (autem, &c.] Here the
Poet speaks of the structure of the
hives, and of the avoiding of some¹

things which are offensive.
Corticibas] The bark ofthe cork

trec was called corten: by way of etni- , 2

nence. Thus Horace: ‘⁶ Τιι cortice
‘⁶ levior-,⁷² Pliny says the Greeks
not inelegantly called this tree the
harlc tree. ‘⁴ Non infacete Graeci cor..
“ ticis arborem appellant-'² We learn
from Columella, thatit was this bark,
which was used for Bechives: “ Igi-
“ tur ordinatis sedibus, alvearia fa-
‘4 bricanda sunt pro conditione regi-
“ onis: sive illa ferax est suberis,
“haud dubitanter utilissimas alvos
“faciemus ex corticibus, quia nec
