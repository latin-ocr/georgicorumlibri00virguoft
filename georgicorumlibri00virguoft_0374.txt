NOTES. ’

278. Boream] Boreas issrequent-
ly used to siguify the north: but
strictly speaking, it is the north-east.
Pliny says the north wind is called
Septentrio, and by the Greeks A-
parchus, and that the Aquilo, called
by the Greeks Boreas is the north-
east: ‘⁶ A Septentrionibus septem-
‘⁶ trio, interque eum et exortum
“ solstitialem Aquilo, Aparctias dicti
“ et Boreas.” I believe there is an
error in the copies of Pliny, and that
instead of interque eum el exortum sol.
stitialem we should read juxtaque elem
’ ad exortum solstitialem: sorthe exor-
tus solstitialis is the north-east 3 and
therefore, according to the common
reading Boreas will bein the north-
north-east3 whereas Pliny is evident-
ly speaking of the compass, as divided
only into eight points: ‘⁵ Veteres
‘⁶ quatuor omnino servavere, per to..
‘⁶ tidem mundi partes, ideo nec Ho-
“ merus plures nominat, hebeti ut
“ moxjudicatum est ratione: secuta
“ aetas octo addidit, nimis subtili et
‘⁴ concisa: proximis inter utramque
‘4 media placuit, ad brevem ex nu-
‘⁶ merosa additis quatuor. Sunt er-
‘4 go bini in quatuor caeli partibus.’'
Aulus Gellius says expressly, that
Boreas is the north-east: “ Qui ab
‘⁶ aestiva et solstitiali orientis meta
‘⁴ venit, Latine Aquilo, Boreas Graece
“ dicitur: eumque propterea quidam
‘⁵ dicunt ab Homero dsOfnyeuirm ap..
‘⁴ pellatum. Boream autem putant
‘⁶ dictum α’πὸ τῆς βοαῖς, quoniam sit
‘⁶ violenti flatus et sonori.’'

Caurum] Caurus, or Corus, ac-
cording to Pliny is the north-west:
“ Ab occasu aequinoctiali Favonius,
ξξ ab occasu solstitiali Corus 3 Ze.

‘⁵ phyron et Argesten vocant ...... ”
“ Huic est contrarius Vulturnus . . . .
“ Ventorum frigidissimi sunt quos a
‘⁶ Septentrione diximus spirare, et
‘⁶ vicinus iis CoruS.” Aulus Gellius
makes Caurus the south-west, for he
places it opposite to Aquilo: ‘⁶ His
“ oppositi et contrarii sunt alii tres
“'occidui : Caurus, quem solent
‘⁶ Graeci α’ργέσἾην vocare, is adver.
‘⁴ sus Aquilonem flat.’' But I be..
lieve Gellius is mistaken, for Virgil,
in ver. 356, represents Caurus as an
exeeeding cold wind:

‘⁶ Semper hyems, semper spirantes
“ frigora Cauri.”

It will not perhaps be unaccept.

shew what names the Ancients gave
to the points of the compass, as they
are mentioned by Pliny. I have al-
ready observed that this author divided
the compass into eight parts. These
I think were evidently the North,
North-East, East, south-East, South,
Smrth-VVest, ¹Nest, and North.

which will shew the place of the sun's

other lines must be drawn obliquely,
from each side of the north to each
side of the south, allthro’ the same
