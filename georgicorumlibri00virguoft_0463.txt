131. Verben-as] The Verben-a,
from whence our English name Ver-
vain is derived, was a sacred herb a-
mong the Romans. We read in the
first book of Livy how this herb was
used in the most ancient league, of
which the memor-y was preserved a-
mong them: that between Tullus
Hostilius, the third king of Rome,
and the Albans. The form was this ε
The Fetialz's said to Tullus, Do you
command me, O king, ίο sti-elce (ι
league with the Pater patratus of the
people of Alba? when the King had
commanded him, he proceeded thus,
O King, [demand tlte Sagmina osyou.
The King answered, Talce it pure.
Then the Fetialis brought the pure
herb from the Tower. . . . The Fe-
lindis was M. Valerius, and he ap-
pointed Sp. Fusius to be the Pater
patratuS, touching his head and hair
with the Vervain ε “Foedera alia aliis
⁶⁶ legibus, caeterum eodem modo omnia
‘⁶ fiunt. Tum ita factum accepimus:

⁶⁶ nec ullius vetustior soederis memo-
⁶⁶ ria est. Fetialis regem Tullum ita
⁶⁶ rogavit: Jubesne me rex cum
⁶⁶ patre patrato populi Albanisoedus
“ferire 2 jubente rege, Sagme'na,
⁶⁶ inquit, te, rex, posco, Rex ait,
⁶⁶ puram tollito. Fetialis ex arce
‘⁶ graminis herbam puram attulit.

⁶⁶ gens.” Pliny says expressly, that
by sagmina and verbenae were meant
the same thing, namely, the herb
from the tower, pluckt up with
it’s earth: and that it was used by
the embassadors, when they were sent
to reclaim any thing that had been
carried away by the euemies3 and
that one of them was therefore cal-
led Verrbenarius .- ⁶⁶ Interim fortius
“augetur autoritas: qnae quanta

ther place he calls itllierahotane,1³e-
rislereon, and V'e2·benaca,· and there
adds, that it was used in brushing
the table of Jupiter, and in purisjiug

houses. lle says there are two sorts
