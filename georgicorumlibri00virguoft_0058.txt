NOTES.

humida solstitia 10 mean the winter
solstice, and imagines that the epi-
thet humida is added as a distinction
from the summer solstice, and there-
fore. interprets this passage thus:
“ Solstitia illa quae humida sunt na-
“ turaliter, id est hyberna, O Agri-
“ eolae, et hyemes serenas 01·ate.'’

Pliny accuses our Poet ofa mist-ake
in this advice, and says it was only a
luxuriance of 1115 wit: “Qui dixit
‘⁶ hyemes serenas optandas, non pro
“ arboribus vota fecit. Nec per sol-
“ stitia imbres vitibus conducunt.
“ Hyberno quidem pulvere laetiores
“ fieri messes, luxuriantis ingenii 101·-
“ tilitate dictum est.'' But Virgil is
sufficiently justified by it’s being an
universally received opinion amongst
the antient Roman husbandmen. We
are told by Macrobius. that in a very
old book of verses, which is said to be
the most antient os all the Latin
books, the following words are to 110
met with: “ Hyberno pulvere, verno
‘⁴ luto, grandia farra Camille metes.''
From this old saying Vin-gil no doubt
derived his advice to the sarmers, to
pray for moist summers and fair win-
1015.

Orata] It is optate in one of the
Arundelian manuscripts, and in La
Cerda. Pliny seems also to have read
optate; for in the passage, which Ι
just now quoted, he says: “Qui
‘⁶ dixit hyemes serenas optandas.'’

102. Nullo tantum se DIysz'a (150]

lt is Moesia in the Bodleian inanu-
script, in Sextius, and in several old
editions, some os the old editions have
Mesia. The Cambridge manuscript
has Messia. Fulvius Ursinus tells 115
that the old Colotian manuscript has
Mysia, which reading is admitted also
by Macrobius, Pierius says it is My-
sia in the Roman manuscript, and in
another veryancient one. Heinsius and
several of the best editors have Mysia.
According to Pliny, Moesia is the
name ota province joining to Pan-
nonia, and running down with the
Danube 10 1110 Euxine sea. But My-
sia is a part of Asia minor joining to
the. I-Iellespont. In this province were
both a mountain and a town called
Gargarus‚ famous for great plenty of
corn. Thus we find in Ovid :

“ Gargara quot segetes, quot habet
‘⁶ Methymna racemos:
“AEquora quot pisces, fronde te·
“ guntur aves3
‘⁶ Quot caelum stellas, tot habet tua
‘⁶ Roma puellas.”

104. Quid dicam,&c.] ln this beau·
tiful passage, the Poetadvises to break
the barren clods immediately after the
seed is sown; and then to overflow
the ground. He recommends also the
feeding down of the young corn, to
prevent it's too great luxuriance: and
mentions the drainingofa marshy soil.

says, that male pinguis is not put for
