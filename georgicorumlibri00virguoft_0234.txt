NOTES.

he proceeds to give some instructions
concerning the planting of vines: and
speaks of the trenches which arc to
be made, to receive the plants out of
the nursery; of taking care that the
nursery and the vineyard should have
a like soil; and that the plants should
be set with the same aspect, which
they had in the nursery.

Multo amca] This is the very ex-
pression of Theophrastus, who says
that ‘⁶ the trenches must be made a
‘⁶ long while before-hand and digged
‘4 deep ε To& δὲ γυροῦς προσορέτἾειν ὡς
“ »ωλὲις-ου χρένου καὶ βαθυτέρους αἐἶ.”
In another place he says it should
be a year before-hand, with which
the other writers agree3 who men-
tion any determinate time. Thus Co.
lumella: ‘⁴ Sed et scrobes et sulci
‘⁶ plurimum prosunt, si in locis tem.
“ peratis, in quibus aestas non est
‘⁶ perfervida, ante annum fiant, quam
“ vineta conserantur.'' Virgil seems
to express that it should be done a
year before-hand3 for he ‘says the
trenches should be exposed to the
north wind and frosts, thatis, should
lie at leasta whole winter. Exco-
quere seems to express it's lying a
whole summer. coquere signifies to
bake the earth with the sun, in the
first Georgick:

“ Pulverulenta coquat maturis soli-
‘⁶ bus aestas.‘'

Mr. Evelyn says “ the longer you

‘⁶ expose the mould, and leave the re.
‘4 ceptacles open (were it for two
‘⁴ whole winters) it soon would re.
“ compense your expectation.”

260. Magnos scrobibus concidere
montes] l can hardly sorbear think-
ing that virgil wrote magma, which
will make the sense be to cut the hills
with great trenches, and agrees with
Theophrastus, whose very words Vir-
gil has almost transcribed, as was ob.
served in the preceding note. But I
prcpose this only as a conjecture, for
it is magnos in all the copies that I
have seen.

Pierius says, it is circundare in the
Roman manuscript, instead of conci.
dere ; and that et is lest out in the
Medicean copy3 which, in truth is
not very unlike Virgil’s style ε
