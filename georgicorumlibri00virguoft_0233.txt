Arundelian it is heu, which, I sup.
pose, is an error of the transcriber,
for nea.

254. Prodit] The King's manu.
script, and La Cerda have promit.

256. Et qais 'cuz' color. Ae scele-
ratum] So I read with Heinsius,
Schrevelius, Masvicins, and others,
Pierius says it is et quis cuive color.
Sceleratum, in some very antient
manuscripts3 and et quis cuique color
at in the Medic-ean. In one of Dr.
Mead’s manuscripts it is et quis cui.
que color. Sceleratum, in the other,
et quis cuique color. At sceleratam.
Servius approves of the common read-
ing, which is ec quisquis color. At
sceleratum.

257. Piceoe.] The Picea is our
common Firr or Pitch-tree, or
Spruce-Firr. -

Taxiqzce nocentes] The berries of
the Yew are said by Pliny to be poi-
sonous: ‘⁶ Lethale quippe baccis, in
‘⁶ Hispania praecipue, venenum in-
‘⁶ est.'’ Julius Caesar also tells us
that Cativulcus poisoned himself with
yew: ²³ Cativulcus rex dimidiae
“ partis Eburonum, qui una cum
“ Ambiorige consilium inierat, ⁷ aea
‘⁶ tate jam confectus, quum laborem
“ aut belli aut fugae ferre non posset,
‘⁶ omnibus precibus detestatus Am-

ιΙιίοῑὶςεῐιι, qui ejus consilii auctor
‘⁶ fuisset, taxo, cujus magna in Gal-
“ lia Germaniaque copia est, se ex-

‘⁶ (τηῐιη(ιυῖῖ.” The leaves also are
said by the ancients to be destructive
to horses, which we find to be true
in England. The berries have been
eaten by rnyself and many others
with impunity: but this may be ow..
ing to the ‹iifference of climate3 for
Dioscorides, who says it is not alike
poisonous in ull places,a affirms that
the berries are poisonons in Italy,
and the shade hurtful in Narbonne
Perhaps the speeies may be different3
for there is mention of a sort of yew
in the Pisa gai-deu, which is more
bushy than the common, and has
leaves more like a firr, and sends
forth such a poisonous smell, when
itis clipped, that the Gardeners can-
not work at it above half an hour at
a time.

258. Hederae migma] The ber..
ries of our common ivy are black,
when ripe, and therefore we may
suppose it to be the ἰν)Υ here spoken
of. There is a white ivy mentioned
in the seventh Eclogue:

‘⁶ Candidior cycnis, hedera formo-
‘⁶ sior alba. '’

We find mention os it also in Theo..
phrastus, Pliny, and Dioscorides:
but we are not now acquainted with

any such plant.
