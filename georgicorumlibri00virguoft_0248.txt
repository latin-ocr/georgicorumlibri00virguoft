tropz‘clc of Capricorn. But the 51111
passes 11110 Capricorn„ at the time of
1119 winter 50151109, which was about
111911 twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of
December. This season could not
possibly be called autumn by virgil.

are the same in the heathen mytho-

Vir-gu here calls the wife of 1119 al-

from 1119 sky: which the Poet ex-
presses by [Ether descending into'the
