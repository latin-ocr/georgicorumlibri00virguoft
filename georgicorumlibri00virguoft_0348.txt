NOTES.

the Poet’s meaning. The first is suf.
ficiently refuted already by La
Cerda: and the other seems to la..
bour under some difficulties. The
cmv-calves are surely as much to be
preserved for brt—eding, as the bull-
calves: and our Poet himself seems,
in another place, to think the great-
est regard is to be had to the cows :

‘⁶ ·--— Seu quis fortes ad aratra ju-
‘⁶ vencos3
‘⁶ Corpora praecipue matrum legat.''

1⁷ have thought therefore of another
interpretation, which seems to me to
express the Poet’s true meaning. He
has just told us, the calves are to be
distinguished into three classes, in
ver. 159, 160, and 161. Ι takea
new sentence to begin with ver. 162,
Ccetera pascuntur, &a The rest of
the hercl, that is those which are de-
signed for breeding, or sacrifice, may
jeecl at large in the meadows, for they
need no other care, than to furnish
them with sufficient nourishment, till
they arrive at their due age. But
those, which (cre clesignedjor agriczcl.
tzere, require more care: they must
be mmcd, whilst they are but calves,
ancl tractable in their temler years.
According to this interpretation, the
Poet has mentioned how all the
three sorts are to be treated, and has
not omitted two of them, as La
Cerda imagines: “ Dixit destinandos
‘⁶ alios ad sobolem, alios ad sacra,
ὕ alios ad agriculturam : nunc, omissis

‘⁶ primis et mediis, loquitur de extre-
‘⁶ mis, qui servantur ad'agricultu.
‘⁴ ram.”

163. Τιι quos (cd stadium, Sco]
Dryden’s translation represents the
Poet speaking after a manner most
strangely figurative. He talks of send-
ing the calf to school, keeping him
from seeing the bad examples of the
world, and instructing him with mo..
ral precepts. For all this he has not
the least countenance from his author,
except it be in the words studium and

juvenum .·
