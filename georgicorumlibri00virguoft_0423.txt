com when they are dyiug5
their skin growsdry, and feels
hurd and rough. These were
the sympturns at the begin-
nine, but when the disease
began to increase, their eyes
were inflamed, and their
bream was t'etched deep,

N OT ES-

“ crebro serii, nor need we be afraid
“ of the false quantity, for Carisius
“ acknowledges the adverb tertio for
‘⁴ a dactyl, and sero isin the measure
‘⁶ of a trochee in Statius.” Pmuns.

The most violent diseases of horses
are frequently attended with anun.
usual stamping on the ground.

500. Demissoe aurem] The hang-
ing down of the ears is mentioned
by Columella, as a symptom of pain
in a horse’s head ε *² Capitis dolorem
‘⁶ indicant lachrymae, quae profluunt,
‘⁶ a‘uresque flaccidae, et cervix cum
‘⁶ capite aggravata, et in terram sum-
‘⁶ missa.”

Incertus sudor] By a (lc)zcb(fzel

εἶπαί, he either means a sweat of

which it may be doubted whether it is
a good or a bad symptom, or else a
sweat that comes and goes uncertainly
and irregularly.

501. Mor-ituris frigidum] In the
Cambridge, one of the Arundelian,
and one of Dr. Mead's manuscripts it
is moriturus.

A cold sweat is universally known
to be a bad symptom:

Ater pellis] The dryness of the
skin i⁴s inconsistent with the sweating
just mentioned. We must therefore
understand the Poet, not to mean that
all these symptoms' were found i'n
every horse, but that they were ra.

riously affected. The cold sweat is
a sign of a diminution of the vital
powers3 and the dryness and hard-
ness of the skin shew that there is a
great inward heat, aud an obstruction
of the matter, which ought to be per..
spired through the pores of the skin.

50⁶2. Et acl tactum] In the Ro„
man manuscript it is at,- and in the
Lombard it is tractum, according to
Pierius.

503. Dant] It is (lat in one of
the Arundclian manuscripts.

505. Ardentes oculi] Thucydides,
in his description of the plagae at
Athens, says thf’y were at first seized
with a heat and heariness in the head,
with a redness and inflammation οἱ
the eyes: Πρῶτον μὲν τῆς κεφαλῆς
Ξέρμαι ἰσχυραὶ καὶ τῶν ὗφὲσιλμῶν
{pfl-istisce, -καῖ φλέγωσις &diacona
Thus also Lucretius:

‘⁶ Principio, caput incensum fervore
‘² gerebant:

‘⁵ Et dupliceis oculos suffusa luce ru.
‘⁵ bentcis.’'
