I have put ingeniis instead os ingentes
on the authority of Pierius, who says it
is ingeniis in all the most ancient
manuscriptS, which he had seen.

custom amongst the Greeks of pro-

verse. Thus Horace ε

‘⁶ Carmine qui tragico rilem certavit
“ ob hircum.⁷’

Hence this sort of poetry came to ob-
tain the name of tragedy from τράγος,

a gout, and dan, α song. There is a

line in Horace not much unlike this
of virgil: it is in his first epistle:

“Quis circum pagos, et circum
(ί compita victor.⁷’

Pagos] Pagus seems to be derived
from πηγή, (ι zcell,· because where
they found a well, they began to
make their habitations.

383. Theseidoe ] Tragedy had its
beginning among the Athenians.
Thespis, an Athenian Poet, who was
contemporary with Solon,improved it,
and is commonly said to have invented

it: tho’ it was very rude even in his
time, as we find in Horacez

“ Ignotum Tragicae genus invenisse

When Thespis first exposed the Tra-

It is even now a custom in Italy,
for the country people, as they
are carying the grapes home, to
tread them in the cart, and, fWsth
