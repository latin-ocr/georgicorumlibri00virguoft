GEORG. LIB. IV.

Vere suo, ludetque favis emissa juventus, m,

Vicina invitet decedere ripa calori ; .

Obviaque hospitiis teneat frondentibus arbos.
ln medium, seu stabit iners, seu profluet humor, 25
’ Transversas salices, et grandia conjice saxa:
Pontibus ut crebris possint consistere, et alas
Pandere ad aestivum solem 3 si forte morantes
Sparserit‚ aut praeceps Neptuno immerserit Eurus.
Haec circum casiae virides, et olentia late

StephenS‚ Schrevelins‚ and La Cer-

vicius read inumbret.

22. Ludetque] In one of Dr.
Mead's manuscripts it is laudetque.

23. Dec-edere] Pierius saysit is
discedere in the Roman manuscript.

26. Transversas salices, etgrandz'd
conjice saxa] Varro would have a
small sti-eamd drawn near the apiary5
not above two 'or three finger-s deep,
with several shells or small stenes
standing a little above the surface of
the water, that the Bees may drink :
‘⁶ Eamque propinquam, quae prae-
“ tex-fluat, aut in aliquem locum in-
“ fluat, ita ut ne altitudine ascen.
‘⁶ dat duo ant tres digitos3 in qua
‘⁶ aqna jaceant testae, aut lapilli, ita
“ ut extent paulum, ubi assidere et
“ bibere possint.⁵' Dryden seems to
understand the Poet to mean, that
the willows arete be thrown into the
standing water, and great stones into
a running stream ε

‘⁴ With osier floats the standing
“ water strow :

“ Os‘massy. stenes make bridges if
⁶ it flow.⁷’

29. Immerserst] In one of Dr.
Mead's manuscripts, and in some of
the old editions it is immiserit.

30. Cama] See the note on book
II. ver. 213. to which I shall add
in this place an argument, to prove
that the casia is not reffemccry, as
some have supposed. Columella,
speaking of the plants which ought
to grow about an apiary, mentions
casia and roscmctry as two different
plants: “ Nam sunt etiam remedio
“languentibus cythisi, tum deinde
‘⁶ ems-ize, atque pini, et rosmaritms.'’

Olente'alate serpylla] ›S'erpglllzmss
in Greek ἕρπυλλον, is derived from
ἕρπω to Creop, because part of it
falling on the ground sends forth
roots, and so propagates the plant.
lt was frequent with the Romans
to change the Greek aspiration in-
to S: thus from ἕρπω they formed
serpo, from ἕρπυλλον serpyllum, from
ὃς sus-7 from ²3:2⁴⁸ semi, from ἓ se,
from ἓξ sex, from {1772 septem, from
ι’πέρ Super, dyc.

The Ancienls mention two sorta
of serpyllum. one ofthe gardens‚ and
the other wild. Our serpyllum, or
mother osthyme, or zce'lrltlzynw, which
is common on ant hills in langland,
