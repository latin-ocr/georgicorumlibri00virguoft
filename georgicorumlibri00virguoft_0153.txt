T bassus, which is an island between
Lemnos and Abdera, a city of
Thrace. Cassius also was sent to
Thassus to be buried. The. situation
of Pharsalia is no less evidently in
Thessaly, being described by Julius
Caesar himself, as near Larissa z aud
besides he says expressiy that the deci-
sive battle between him and Pompey
was fought in Thessaly. Hence it
appears, that the whole country of
Macedon lay between the fields in
which those great battles were fought.
Ruaeus has thought of a new way
to resolve the difficulty. He refers
iterum, not to Philippi, but to the
Roman armies3 and makes the sense to
be, that Philippi sua* the Roman ar..
mies eng-age α secondtz'me .· that it was
indeed the first tIme, that Philippi
saw them engage, but that it was the
second time of their engaging. This
solution is very ingenious: but it
seems to be attended with another
difficulty. The Poet immediately,
adds that Emathia and the plains of
Haemus were twice sattened with
Roman blood. Servius says Ema-
thia is Thessaly: ‘⁶ Emathia Thes-
‘⁶ salia est, dicta ab Emathio rege.’'
If this be true, Emathia cannot be
said to have been twice sattened with
Roman blood: it having been al-
ready proved, that the second war
was in Thrace. Besides Virgil men..
tions the plains os Haemus, which
every body knows to be in Thrace.
But Pliny· expressly says that Mace..
don was anciently called AEmathia:
‘⁶ Macedonia postea cl populorum,
‘⁶ duobus inclyta regibus quondam·
{ique terrarum imperio, AEmathia

‘⁵ antea dicta.” Rursus justly ob„
serves, that Macedon may be said to
have been twice fattened with Ro,
man blood3 because the plains of
Philippi and Pharsalia are both on
the confines of Macedon. But this
learned Commentator’s interpretation
with regard to Haemus seems not
very clear. He would have bis to
refer only to Emathia, and not to
Haemus: as if Virgil had said, Ema-
thia :cas twice saltened :sith Roman
blood, but above all mount Haemus
once. ἱ cannot be persuaded that the
Poet had so obscure a meaning,
which seems little better than a mere
quibble.

For my part, I believe Virgil is to
he understood as using the latitude of
a Poet, not the exactness osa Histo-
rian, or a Geographer. He seems
to have considered all that part of
Greece, which contains Thessaly,
Epirus, and Ixiacedon, quite to the
foot of Mount Haemus, as one coun-
try. Strabo the Geographer tells us
that some reckon Epirus a part of
Macedon: ἔνιοι δὲ καὶ σύμπασαν
τὶν μέχξι Κσξκῦξας, Μακεδονίαν vrgo-
σαγορὲυοισινε and Pomponius Mela
seems to speak of Thessaly as apart
also of Macedon: ‘4 In Macedonia
‘⁶ prima cst Thessalia3 deinde Mag-
“ nesia, Phthiotis.’' Nor is Virgil
singular in ascl-ibing both wars to the
same tract of land. Ovid intro.

the death of Julius Caesar, and tel-

Augustus, and that Philippi shall be
