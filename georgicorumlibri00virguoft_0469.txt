NOTES.

because merces and mercor are de-
rived from mereor. This interpreta-
tion, he sayS, is the only one that
agrees with this passage, for the Poet
is speaking of the merit, by which the
Bees were admitted to assist the Cu-
retes in nursing Jupiter. But, as
was just now observed, the Poet
seems rather to mean, that he will
speak of the rea-ard which they had
for their service.

canoros Curetum sonitus crepitan-
tiaque oera.] According to the table,
Saturn intended to have devoured the
infant Jupiter, to avoid which, he
was concealed among the Curetes, the
clangor of whose brasen armour and
cymbalS‚ as they danced, would drown
his cries ι thus Lucretius :

“ Dictaeos referunt Curetas, qui Jo-
“ vis illum

“ Vagitum in Creta quondam occul.
“ tasse feruntur,

“ Cum pueri circum puerum pernice
“- chorea

“ Armati in numerum pulsarent aeri-
“ bus aera,

‘4 Nc Saturnus eum malis mandaret
‘⁶ adeptus,

“ AEternumque daret matri sub pec-
“ tore vulnus.’'

These represent those armed priests,
ἰτΙιο strove
To djozon tlze tender eries os insunt
ove ;

By dancz'ng quict- they made α greater
And ZZZgzttfi’ez'r armour, as they danc’d
Lestcggclicyicrlz'should have found ancl
eat the hoff,
And Ops for ever mourn’d her prat-
tling joy.

Dictoe or Dictoeus' mons is a moun.
tain of Crete, where Jupiter was said
to be concealed.

154. Magnaque agitant.] In one
of Dr. Mead's manuscripts, and in
some of the printed editions, it is
magnis agitant, without que.

155. Et patriam soloe et certos 710-
rere penates] “ In some manu-
“ scripts we read α patriam solae, et
‘⁵ certos novere penates. For α is
“not always an interjection of la-
“ menfing, but sometimes signifies
‘² admiration. But that α is written
‘⁵ without an aspiration has been else-
“ where proved from Probus. In
“the Lombard manuscript, there is
“ no et in the second place3 but it is
‘⁴' read Et patriam sola> certos novere
“ penates. Butthose who take away
“ et here, deprive the verse also of
“ all its elegance.” Pierius.

156. Laborem] In one of the

Arundelian manuscripts itis ἶῖιέξηῗ.
