330. Parem-it almus agera] In
oue of the Arundelian manuscripts it
is parturit alma V enus,

332. Gramina] In the King's
manuscript it is germina.

336. Non ulios, esea] Ι take the
Poet's meaning here to be, not that
there was a perpetual spring, at the
beginning of the world: but that it

was the spring season, when cattle,
and men were created. He assigns
this reason for it: the new created
beings would not have been able to
have sustained the extremities of heat
or cold3 and therefore, it must have
been spring, when they were created,
that they might have time to grow
hardy, before a more inclement sea-
son should begin.

Dryden has greatly debased the ele.
gance of these lines, by making use of
vulgar, and, in this place, ridiculous
expressions:

‘⁶ In this soft season (let me dare
‘⁶ to sing)

‘⁶ The world was hateh’d by hea-
“ ven's Imperial King

‘⁶ In prime of all the year, and
‘⁶ hely-days of spring.”

340, Cum primatu] In one of
the Arundelian manuscripts, and in
an old Paris edition, printed in 1494,
it is tumprz‘mum. In the Cambridge
manuscript, it is cumprimum. Pie.
rius says it is cum primae, in the Ro-
man and Medicean manuscripts.
