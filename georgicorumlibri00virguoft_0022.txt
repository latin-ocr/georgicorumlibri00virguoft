xii THE Pannona

the translations to' be convinced of this, Dryden, endea»
vouring to keep up the spirit of the original, could noti
avoid being obscene ancl lascivious in his expressious; and
Dr. Trapp, whose character laid him under a necessity of
avoiding that rock, has sunk into an insipid fiatness, un-
worthy of the Poet whom he has translated. But in thc
original, the sentirnents are warni and lively, and the expres-
sions strong and masculine. And yet he does not make use
of a word unbecoming the gravity of a Philosopher, or the
modesty of a virgin. The pestilence that reigned among
the Alpine cattle is confessedly a rnaste1·-piece; and not 111,-
ferior to the admired description which Lucretius has given
of the plague at Athens. The story of Orpheus and Eury-
dice is told in so delightful a manner, that, had it been less
of a piece with the main Poem, we could not but have
thanked the author for inserting 11.

These, and innumerable other beauties, which cannot ea-
sily escape the observation of a judicious reader, are sufficient
to make the Georgicks esteemed as the finest Poem that ever
appeared. But the work is not only beautiful, but useful

prose writers among the Romans have appealed to Virgil,
as to an oracle, in affairs of Husbandry. And though the
soil and climate of Italy are different from those of Eng-

his rules may be put in practice, even here, to advantage.

This was the Poem on which V irgil depended for his re-
putation with posterity. He desired on his death-bed, that
his AEneis might be burnt; but was willing to trust the
Georgicks to future ageS. The reason ofthis conduct seems
to be obvious. The AEneis was unfinished, and had not
received the last hand of the author. And though it has
justly been the admiration of all succeeding tImes; yet this
great master thought it unworthy of his pen. He was con-
scious, that it fell short of the Iliad, which he had hoped

to exceed; and like a true Roman, could not brook a su·
perior. But in the Georgicks, he knew that he had triumph-

ed‘over the Greek Poet. This Poem had received the finish-
ing stroke, and was therefore the fittest to give posterity an

idea of the genius of its author. Nor was the Poet disapci
