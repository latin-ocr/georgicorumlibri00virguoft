355 the husbandman often observ-

ing, should keep their lurds
nem-er the stall. When the
winds are rising, either the
sti-aits of the sea work and be-
gin to swell, and a dr)¹ craek-
lingis heard in the mountains3
or the far resounding shores be-
gin to echo, and the murmur
os the groves to thicken. Now

quod. Servius has the same reading,
and it is in some of the old printed
editions. Pierius says it is quid in the
Roman and Medicean manuscripts.

356. Continuo sentix, Sca] Here
the Poet gives us the signs of the
winds rising.

It is more easy to admire than de-
scribe the beauty of these lines of our
Poet. The very motion of the swell-
ing sea is expressed in these words,
which seem to rise gradually with the
waves z

These beauties are too frequent in
virgil to escape the observation of
most readers: but it would be un-

parduna-hle in a commentator not to
take notice of them.

The swelling os the sea, the re-
sounding of the coasts, and the roar-

ing of the mountains are mentioned
as prognosticks of wind by Aratus,
whom Virgil has imitated in his prc-
dictions of the wcather ε

it is arduus in the Roman manuscript.
Aridus fragor means a dry craek-
ling sound, like that of trees> when
they break.

360. Jccm sibe· tum a cursim] In
all the manuscripts I have consulted
the preposition α is omitted 3 as also
in many printed editions. Pierius
says it is α curvis in the Roman ma-
nuscript. Heinsius retains the pre-
position: and in the only passage,
beside this, where virgil uses tempero
in the same sense, we find a before
the ablative case ε
