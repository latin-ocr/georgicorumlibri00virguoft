But when tin-ec Summers are
past and the fourth is begun,

P. VIRGILII MARONIS

At, tribus exactis, ubi quarta accesserit aestaS‚

NOTES.

190. At tribus emetis] In the
liing's manuscript it is ac instead of at.

Varro says some would break a
horse at a year and half old: but he
thinks it is better to stay till he is
three years os age: ⁶⁶ Cum jam ad
‘⁶ manus accedere consuerint, inter..
‘⁶ dum imponere iis puerum bis, aut
‘⁶ ter pronum in ventrem, postea
“jam sedentem, haec facere cum
‘⁶ sit trimus.- tum enim maxime
“ crescere, ac lacertosum fieri. Sunt
‘⁶ qui dicant post annum et sex
⁶⁶ menses equulum domari posse, sed
‘⁶ melius post trimum, a quo tem.
⁶⁶ pore farrago dari solet.'’ Colu-
mella makes a distinction between
those which are bred sor domestic
labour, and those which are bred
sor racesg he says the former should
be tamed at two years, and the lat-
ter not till 116 is past three: ⁶² Equus
‘⁴⁶ bimus ad usum domesticum recte

‘⁶ domatur, certaminibus autem ω’--

‘⁶ pleto triennio, sic tamen ut· post
‘⁶ quartum demum armum labori
‘⁶ committatur.'’

U bi quarta accesserit cestus] ⁶⁶ Al-
‘⁶ most all the ancient manuscripts
⁶⁶ have cetus, except only that most
“ancient one, which we call the
‘⁶ Roman, in which we find vbi
‘⁶ quarta acceperit ces-ms. But Servius
‘⁶ acknowledges alas, and explains
⁶⁵ it quartus annus, . . . ‚But sor my
‘⁶ part Ι neither dislike acceperit nor
⁶⁶ cesum, as we have the testimony
⁶⁶ of so ancienta manuscript, which
⁶⁶ Ι think may be depended upon in
‘⁶ whole words, tho¹ it is often very
⁶⁶ corrupt in letters.” Pmmus.

The King’s, the Cambridge, the
Bodleian manuscripts, and the old
Nurenberg edition have oetas. Both
the Arundelian, both Dr. Mead’s
manuscripts, several of the old edi.
tions, Heinsius, Masvicius, Ruaeus‚
and most of the later editors read
testas. La Cerda reads oetas; but
he thinks aestas not amiss, which he
says is a phrase used by Virgil,twice
in the first AEneid, and once in the
fifth. The first of these passages is
not to our purpose, for he does not
use (ustas for a year, but only for a
summer:

⁶⁶ Tertia dum Latio regnantem vi-
⁶⁶ derit aestas,

⁶⁶ Ternaqne transierint Rutulis hy-
⁶⁶ berna subactis?

Here three summers are joined to
three winters, in order to express
three years. The second and third
passages appear to me to come up to
the point: tho’ some Criticks con-

tend that they mean only the summer
season:

<C

 

Nam te jam septima portat
⁶⁶ Omnibus errantem terris et flucti-
“ bus aestas:”

And

‘⁶ Septima post Trojae excidium jam
⁶⁶ vertitur aestas.”

Here oestas cannot, without great
violence, be construed to signisy the
summer season. It was winter when
AEneas was at Carthage: ἐς I
