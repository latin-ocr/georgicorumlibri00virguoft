118. Pingues hortos] It will not
perhaps be disagreeable to the render,
is in this place l make some little in-
quiry into the gardens of the An-
cients. Those of the Hesperides,
thoe of Adonis, Alcinous, Semira-
mis, and Cyrus, have been celebrated
with large praises. We may easily
apprehend, what sort of gardens the
most magnificent ones of ancient
Greece were, hythe description which
Homer has lest us of that of Alci-
nous The whole garden was of no
larger extent than four acres: and
yet it is called by Homer a large gar-
den or orchard ε

Ἐκᾶ-ὄσῆεν δ’ αὗλῆς μέγας ’ὄρχατος eis-yx»
κυραων

Τετρσύγυος.

Our English word orclzard, or per-
haps rather, as Milton writes it, or-
chat, seems to be derived from the
Greek word 'dmm-rog, which Homer
here uses to express the garden of
Alcinous: and indeed it seems rather
to have been an orchard than what
we call a garden. It consiSted of
Pears‚ AppleS, Pomcgranates, Figs‚

Olivcs, and vines. Round these
were bcds of her-bs and tlowers7 and
the whole was senced in with a hedge.
The garden which Laertes cultivated
with his own royal hands, seems to
have been much of the same sort.
The Romans seem to have proceedcd
much farther in their taste of Gar-
dening in Virgil's time. We here
find not only fruit-trees, and roscs,
lilios, and (laffodils, with some pot-
herbs; but also rows of elms and
planes for shade. Columella speaks
of inclosing them with walls as well
as withhedgges : anda few years asten>
wards, we find them arrived to a de-
gree of magnificence eqnal to the
fincst modern gardens: as the reads-r
may sec in the fifth book of the Epis.
tles ofthc younger Pliny.

intuba rit-iffi] Pierius says this verse
is read differently in the Lombard
manuscript:

(ί Quoque modo positis gauderent in-
“ t) bafibrz's.’'

The plant which Virgil means in this
place is Endivc7 that being the name¹
of the garden σέρις, whereas the wild
sort is our Succory. See the note on
