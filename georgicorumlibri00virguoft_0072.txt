NOTES.

501ηο ploughs had carth-boards‚ and
others not. “ Aratra simplicia, vel

is the share-bearn, a picce of wood
to which the share is fixed. But why
they arc said to have a double back
5001115 not to be very clear. The coni-
montators generally agree that by
double is meant broad, and quote 501110
authorities for this interpretation.
Servius indeed tells 115, that 111051 of
the plough-sharcs 111 Italy havea wing
011 each sidc3 “ cujus utrumque cmi-
“ net latus: nam fere hujtmnodi sunt
‘⁴ 01111105 vomeres in Italia.'' On this
account virgil might have called the
share double, but why the board
should be said to have a double back,
Ι (10 not readily comprehend. Λ pas-
sage in 11051οἀ seems to be of 501110
use in rcmoving this difficulty. It is
agreed on all hands, that Vin-gil had
Hesiod's plough before him when he
made this description. The Greek
Poot speaking os the γύης, which all
interpret (Ic-male, says it is fastencd to
the plough-mil, and at the same time
nailed to the pole ι

- - - Φὲρειν δὲ γύην, ὅτ’ ἄν ἕψῃς,
Εἷς zitola, ›zu-‘r' ’ὄρος διζήμενος η κατ’ ἔρεξαν,

Εἷτ ἂν Ἀθηναιῆς (1μῶος ἔν ἐλύματι ’ω’ἦξας,

Now if we suppose the dentale or
&hare-boam to have been made with
two legs, 0110 of which was fastened
to the bottoni of the mil, and the
other nailed to the boam, which
would make all three hold faster to-
¹aether: it will easily appear, that
virgil means these two legs by his
duplex dorsum, Hesiod speaks oftwo
50115 of ploughs, one with the plough-
tail and share-bean] osone picce, and
another, where they are joined. 110
advises to have both these in readi-
mss, that if one should break the
other may beat hand.

Sti-oa is the plough-staff, which with
us is generally fixed to the share-
beam, in the same manner as the Im-
Τίς, or tall, so that we have two tails
or handles to our ploughs: butsome-
