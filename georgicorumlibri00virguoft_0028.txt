NOTES.

,3. Qui cultas] Pierius 10115 115,
that in the Roman, the Lombard,
the Medicean, and some antient
manuscripts it is qui. The same
reading is in all the manuscripts Ι
have collati-(l, except that of the
King's Library, and one of Dr.
Mead's, where it 15 quis. La Corda,
and some other printed editions, have
quis: but Heinsius, and most of the
best editors read qui.

4. Pecori: apibus] Some editions
hare atque, between pecori and api-
Ims‘, to avoid 1110 synaloepha. But
Ρ101·1115’1155111·05 us, that in all 1110
most amient manuscripts he had
seen, atque is left out. lt is wanting
in the King's‚ the Cambridge, 1110
Bodleian, and in one of Dr. Mcad’s
manuscripts. In another of Dr.
Mead’s, there is only quc, which
Pierius observes to 1111110110011 gene-
rally inserted in the Lombard inanu-
5011111, when· there would be a syna-
loepha. This sieure however is sre-
qnent in Virgil: 1’101“111)(111()105 many
instances. 15111111 mention only one,
which is in the third Georgiek:

ΓΤ Arcem> gravido pee0ri; armenta·
“ que pasce5.’'

iia-insius and Masvicius leave out at-
que: but La Corda, Ruoeus, and
11105101Ὶ 1110 common editions keep
11 111.

Iz'aperientia] This is generally un-
derstood to mean the experience
which 15 required 111 us to manage

13005. Ruaeus interprets it in this
sense, “ quanta industria, 111 alan-
“ tur apes frugales.'’ But in his
notes he proposes another sense, mak-
ing eapericntia to signify the expe-
rience‚ prudence, or ingenuity, of
the Bees. “ Praeter interpretatio·
‘⁶ nem ja'm traditam afferri potest
“ haec altera: Dicam quae sit apum
‘² experientia, prudentia, ingenium,
“ ars quaedam: non usu quidem
“ comparata, sed ingenita.'' Dry-
(1011 translates apibus quanta experien-
tia

“ Thltj* birth and genius of the frugal
‘⁸' ee.'’

Mr. 13- translates 11

“ Wlialt mighty arts to thrifty bees*
“ be ong.''

Dr. Trapp has it Ι

‘⁶ The experience of the parsimonious
⁴⁶ bce.'’

110 is very fond of this new interpre-
tation of Ruaeus: “ To me (says
“ lie) 11 15 much the best sense3 be· ,
“ cause it is litera-1, and yet most
“ poetieai. According to the other
“ construction, the expression is ve-
“ ry harsh3 and not to be support-
“ ed by any parallel place that 1
“ know off This learned gentle·
man is mistaken‚ when hev thinks
that only Ruoeus mentions cleis senze,-
