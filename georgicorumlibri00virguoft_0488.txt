NOTES.

233. Oceani munem] Thus Homer:
ῥόος ω’κεανοῖο.

⁶234. Aac eadem, &c.] It has
been already observ-cd, in the note on
book Ι. ver. 2:21, that the morning
setting of the Pleiades is about the
latter end of October, or beginning
of November.

Sidus fugiens ubi piscis aquosi]
The Commentators are greatly divi-
ded about the constellation, which
the Pleiades are here said to avoid.
Servius affirms it is the southern fish,
that receives the water of Aquarius
in his mouth, in which he is followed
by May :

‘⁴ Againe tehen she tlte southern ιῙῖςΙι
“ dOlllflJJ>

“ To winter scas descending heaci-
ιι [μ’.

Catrou says it is the constellation
Piscis.- “suyant la presence du signe
'²‘ des poissons.” He observes in his
note, that the Pleiades set before the
Fish arise: ‘⁶ Les Pleiades se cou-
“ chent avant que le signe des pois-
(ί sons se leve.’' La (jemla was of
the smne opinion, but he says he will
not disputo with any one, who shall
suppose it to be the Delphin. Huaeus
contends that the lr'jssb‘a is meant,
which secius to [ΜΞΝ-ψ (lte Pleiades,
and inaug over them. Dryden says it
is the Scorpion ε

“ Agant when their affrightcd quire

‘⁴ The wat'ry Scorpion mend his

‘⁵ With a black train of storms and

“ They plunge into the deep, and
‘⁶ safe protection find.'’

The setting of the Pleiades is confes-
sed to mean the latter end of October
οι· beginning of November, perhaps
the eighth, for on that day Columella.
says they set in the morning, and ac-
cording to the same author, winter
begins the next. This agrees very
well with their descending into the
winter-y waters. Now we may rea-
sonably suppose, that the constella-¹
tion which they avoid, is one that
rises in the morning about the same
time, or seon after they set. The
Scorpion, according to Columella,
rises on the thirteenth of December:

¹⁶⁶ Idibus Decembris Scorpio totus

‘⁶ mane exoritur,’⁷ This is in favour
of Drjden, only I can see no reason
for calling the Scorpion by the name
ofpz'scls aquosas. The Scorpion is no
fish, nor is it's usual habitation in the
water. The Delphin riscs on the
twenty-sevcrith of December: ‘⁶' Sex-
ί( to calendas ,lanuarias Delphinus
ι( incipit oriri mane.” The sun does
not ent-er Aquarius till the middle of
Jannary, nor Pisces till the middle of
February. The Dolphin therefore 1
seems to be the constellation meant,
:ts it rises sooner after the setting of
the Pleiades, than any other sish '

delineated on the sphcre. As for the
Hydra,
