, known fact: and it is as well known,
that such eggs never produce a living
animal. These fruitless eggs are call..
ed by us wind eggs, as Varro calls
them ὑπηνέμιαε and thus Aristotle
uses a like expression with regard to
file mares, ἒξανεμοῦσθαι.

277. Non Eure‚taos, ἄτα] Here
Virgil widely differs from Aristotle3
who says expressly that they run,
neither towards the east, nor west,
but towards the north or south,
Hence some of the Criticks have
taken great pains to draw the Philo-
sopher and the Poet into the same
opinion. In order to this, some have
supposed the Poet's meaning to be
that they run, not towards the east,
but towards the north, west, and
south. Thus Grimoaldus paraphrases
it: ‘⁶ Non orientem solem versus,
‘⁶ sed in septentrionem, in occiden-
⁶⁶ tem, et in austrum nebulosum
‘⁶ atque pluviosum.” Thus also La
Cerda: '“ Quin uno excepto Eum,
⁶⁶ nam cum hoc nullus est illis amor,
⁶⁶ alios quoque amant ventos. Cur-
‘⁶ runt enim versus Septentrionem,
⁶⁶ unde flant Boreas et Caurus: cur-
‘⁶ runt versus Austrum, his enim
⁶⁶ ventis maritantur.'’ This last
Commentator, not content with
straining virgil, lays hold on Ari-
stotle in the next place, and coxnpels
him to say the very same. Instead
Of θέουσι δὲ ὀὐτε πρὸς ἕω, ’ὄντε πρὶς
δυσμὰς, α’λλίι πρὸς ἄρκτον, ἦ νότον,
he would fain read &ioum δὲ ὃν πρὸς
2¹42, α’λλὰ πρὸς δυσμαῖς, ἢ ἄρκτον, ἢ
νὸΊον. He might, with as little vio-
leuce, hare made Aristotle ¹say θέουσι

δὲ ἆυ ἐρὲς ἕω, οἷλλεῖ πρὸς δυσ-μεὶς,
ὃν ωρός ἄρκτον ἢ vator, Which would
have exactly agreed with the most
obvious meaning of Virgil’s words.
Virgil says expressly, that they turn
to the west3 “ore omnes versae in
⁶⁶ Zephyrum ;'’ which seems the
most probable, if he spake of the
mares of Lisb0n3 for the nearest sea
to them is the western ocean, and
we have heard Aristotle say, that
they run towards the sea. As for
the mares which Aristotle mentions,
they seem to have been those of
Crete, and probably fed about mount
Ida, the most celebrated place in
that island. This being admitted,
we need but consider.. that as Crete
extends in length, from east to west,
and as Ida is in the middle of the
island, the running directly to the
sea, and to the north or south is ex.
actly the same thing.

The Eurus, according to Pliny,
is the southaeast: ‘⁶ Ab oriente ἰὼ
‘⁶ quinoctiali Subsolanus, ab oriente
“brumali Vulturnus: illum Ape-
‘⁶ lioten, hunc Eurum Graeci ap..
‘⁶ pellant.³’ According to Aulus Gel-
lius, Eurus is the east, and the same
with the Subsolcmus and Apeliotes:
‘⁶ Qui ventus igitur ab oriente verno,=
⁶⁶ id est, aequinoctiali venit, nomi.)
⁶‘ natur Eurus, ficto vocabulo, ut}
α isti ἓτυμολογικοῖ aiunt, α’πό τῆς ἕω
⁶⁶ ῥέων, is alio quoque a Graecis
‘⁶ nomine ἀπηλιώτης, a Romanis nau-
‘⁶ ticis Subsolanuscognominatur ..... l ¹
‘⁶ Hi sunt igitur tres venti orientales,
⁶⁶ Aquilo, Vulturnus, Eurus: quo-J
ξι rum medius Eurus est.’' ”
