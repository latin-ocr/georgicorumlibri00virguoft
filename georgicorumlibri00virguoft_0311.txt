NOTES‚

53. crurum tenus α mento palearia
pendent] The low hanging of the
dewlaps is mentioned also by the
prose writers, Thus Varro: a collo
palearibus demissis .· and Columella:
palearibus 'et caudis· amplissimis .- and
Palladius ε palearibus et cazalis maxi.
mis. Dryden, instead of knees, has
stigias, which I believe are under-
stood to belong only to the hinder
legs:

“ Her double ‹lew-lap from her chin
“ descends:

ξ( And at her (hig-ks the pond⁷rous
‘⁴ burden end5.’'

54. Longo nullus lateri modus: om-
[pia magum] This length of the body
and largeness of all the limbs is com.
mended also by Varro: ‘⁶ Ut sint
“ bene cmnposstae, ut integris mem-
‘⁶ bris oblongae, amplae . . . . corpore
“ amplo, bene eostam, latis humeris,
‘⁶ bonis clunibus :’' and by Colu.
mella: “ Vaccae quoque probantur
‘⁶ altissimae sormae longaeqme, maxi.
“ mis uteris.’'

55. Pes etiam, et camuris hirlae
nub cornibus aures] It has been
'generally understood that the Poet
means the soot should be large; and
the verses are pointed thus:

(ί

 

Omnia magna ε
“ Pes etiam= et camuris hirtae sub
“ cornibus aures.’'

‘flans May translates:

“ All must be great: yea even her
“ feet, her esre

“ Under her crooked hernes must
‘² rough appe-are ε’·

And Dryden ε

“ Rough are her ears2 and broad her
“ horny seet.’'

And Dr. Trapp ε

 

“ —- All parts huge;

“ Her feet t003 and beneath her
“ crankled horns

“ Her ears uncouth and rough.”

But La Cerda justly observes that
virgil, who follows Varro in all the
other parts of this description, is not
to be supposed, absolutely to contra-
dict him in this one particular. Be.
sides no one writer speaks of broad
feet as any excellence in a cow:
and indeed the smallness of this crea.

ture's f00t‚ in proportion to the bulk ’

of her whole body, is a great advan-
tage in treading in a deep soil. Varro
says expressly the foot must nothe
broad: “ Pedibus non latis, neque
“ ingredientibus qui displodantur,
“ nec eujus ungulae divaricent, et
“ cujus ungues sint leves et pares.”
And Columella says, ‘⁴ Ungulis

'“ modicis, et modicis cruribus.”

The hairiness of the ears is men·

-tioned by the other authors, Varro

and Columella say pilosis auribus.
Palladius says the ears should be brist.
ly: c'mre setosa.
