that I rmnember, nor can I guess
upon what authority Servius could
relate vither that there was an eclipse
about that time, or that it happened
1119 day before Caesar's murder.
Ovid speaks osa paleness of the sun:

⁶⁶ -—— Phoebi quoque tristis imago
⁶⁶ Lug-‘da sollicitis praebebat lumina
terris.’'

Pliny makes use indeed of the word
defectus, but 119 cannot possibly be
understood to mean what is properly
called an eclipse, · because he speaks
of it’ s lastineg a whole. year3 ⁶⁶ Fi-
‘⁶ unt prodigiosi etlongioies solis 19
‘⁶ fectus, qualis occiso dictator ¹e Cae
⁶⁶ sare, et Antoniano 119110, totius
⁶⁶ pene anni pallore continuo.’' Ti-
bullus also says the misty year saw
the darkned sun drive pale horses:

⁶⁶ Ipsum etiamsolem defectum lu- ’

“ mine vidit
⁶⁶ Jungere pallentes nubilus annus
⁶⁶ equos.’'

Plutarch, in his life of Julius Caesar,
goes sarther. He not only mentions
1119 paleness of the sun, sor a whole
year after Caesar’s death: but adds,
that sor want of the natural heat of
the sun, the fruits maed, without
coming to maturity. Dryden has
fallen into 1119 error, that the sun
predicted Caesar’s death:

⁶⁶ He first 1119 fate of Caesar (lid
⁶⁶ soretel‚

Hyacinth, which is also called parpa-

468. Impia saecula] By sset-ula
the Poet means men, in imitation of
Lucretius, who frequently uses that
word, for kind, species, or sex. Out
of many examples Ι shall select a
few: in the fifth book he calls man-
kind hominum soecla .·

⁶⁶ Quod si sorte fuisse antehac eadem
⁶⁶ omnia credis:

⁶⁶ Sed periisse hominum torrenti soe-
⁶⁶ cla vapore.''

In the fourth book he calls the female
sex muliebre soeclzcm .·

⁶⁶ Et muliebre oritur patrio de semine
⁶⁶ saeclzcmfi

In the second book, soecla is used
for the several kinds of animals:

⁶⁶ Effoetaque tellus

⁶⁶ Vix animalia parva creat, quae
‘⁶ cuncta creavit

‘⁶ Soecla, deditque ferarum ingentia
