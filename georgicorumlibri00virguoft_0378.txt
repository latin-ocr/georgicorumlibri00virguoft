NOTES.

And in the third 3

‘4 Vere madent udo terrae ac pluvi.
“ alibus Austris.’²

And in the ninth AEneid:

6(

 

 

Jupiter horridus Austris
“ Torquet aquosam hyemem.’'

But I think it seems not quite so
plain, that it ever was accounted a
cold wind. I have sometimes in-
clined to think, that we ought to
read sidere instead of frigore, with
the Roman and Cambridge manu-
scripts: but that will not fully answer
our purpose, for we have another in-
stanee of the south wind’s beingcalled
eold by Virgil. It is in the fourth
Georgick, where he says, ·

“ Frigidus ut quondam sylvis immur-
“ murat Auster.'’

Macrobius endeavours to solve this
difficulty, by saying the south-wind
is cold at it’s origin, and is only ac-
cidentally warm, by passing thro’
the torrid zone. But this is a very
trifling solution. For what signifies
the coldness of this wind at it’s ori-
gin, when it is warm with regard to
us? Besides, if I am not much mis-
taken, the Ancients had no notion
of it's coming from the pole, but
thought it arose in Africa, which
was the most southern part of the
world, that they knew: Lybiae de-
vexus in Austros, says our Poet him-
sels in the first Georgitzk. And Pliny
speaks of a rock in the Cyrenaic
province‚ which is in Africa, that

is sacred to the south wind: ‘⁶ Quia
“ et in Cyrenaica provincia, rupes

“ quaedam Austro traditur sacra3*

“ quam profanum sit attrectari ho.
“ minis manu, confestim austro vol.
“ vente arenas.” Ruaeus will have
frigus in this place to stand only for
a rainy season, as hyems is also used
frequently. This Ι believe is only a
conjecture of his own. The only

way Ι can find to extricate us from ,
this difficulty, is by observing that ;
the south wind was not always ac. f

counted warm. Columella speaks of
ivs blowing in ,Ianuary ‘and‘ {3331}-
{ryc'aliriilebijsffigiggAfflr'ium transit,
“ Leo mane incipit occidere, Africus,
“ interdum Auster cum pluvia. . . .

“ Cal. Feb. Fidis incipit occidere, Α

‘⁶ ventus eurinus, et interdum Auster
‘⁴ cum grandine est. . . . .Nonas
‘⁶ April, Favonius aut Auster, cum
‘⁴ grandine.’' Now it appears from
the same author, that the time, when
the mares are seized with this fury
is about the vernal equinox: ‘⁶ Ge.
(ί nerosis circa vernum aequinoctium
“ mares jungentur....Maxime ita.
‘⁶ que curandum est praedicto tem.
‘⁶ pore anni, ut. . . ‚desiderantibus
“ coeundi fiat potestas, quoniam id
“ praecipue armentum si prohibeas,

“ libidinis extimulatur suriis.” Virgil‘

therefore speaking of the south-wind
about the beginning of our March
calls it cold at that season, with great
propriety.
