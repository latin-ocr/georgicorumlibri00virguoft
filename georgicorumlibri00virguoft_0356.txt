seventh book he treats them as fabu-
lons: Διὰ-δὲ τὴν ἄγνοιαν τῶν τόπων
τούτων, οἱ τὰ Ῥιπαῖα ὅρη, καὶ τοίς ‘Trep-
ςορεῖους μυθοποιοῧίῖες. ln hiS eleventh
book he tells us that the ancient
Grecians called all the northern
nations Scythians and Celto-Scythi-
ans; but that the most ancient of all
called those which lie to the north
of the Black Sea, the Danube, and
the Gulph of Venice, Hyperboreans,
Sauromatae and Arimaspians: ‘'Amssaq

find here that the Arimaspians lived
to the northward of the river Tanais,
and the lake Maeotis. They in-
habited therefore the country which
is now· called Muscovy. On the
north part of this country were
situated the Riphaean mountains,

W'e find in the foregoing passage of l
Pliny, that the Riphaean mountains
