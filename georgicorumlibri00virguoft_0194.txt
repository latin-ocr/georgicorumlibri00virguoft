NOTES.

‘⁶ Africa quot segetes, quot Tmolia
‘⁶ terra racemos.¹'

Phanae or l'hanaea is tho name of a
mountain osChios‚ now called Scio.
'she Chian wincs are abundantly ce-
lein-ami by the Greek and Roman
wrm rs.

99. Argitis] This is thought lo
be so called from Argos, a city, and
kingdom in the Merca, or ancient
Peloponnesus. Some think it is de-
rived from ἀργὸς, white, in which sense
May has translated it:

“ And white grapes, less' than those.''

101. Dis ct mensim] Sol find it in
the King's. the Cambridge, the Bod-
leian, and one of the Arundelian ma-
nuscripts. 111 the other Al‘Undelian,
it is Dffs aut mensis. In both Dr.
Meacl’s manuscripts, it is mensis et
Dis,· which order of the words is
preferred by Pierius, wherein he is
followed by most os the editors. He
aclxnowledges however that Dis et
mensis is in most of the ancient ma-
nuscripts he has seen: and this read-
ing is approved by Heinsius, and Mas-
vicius.

'l'he first course was of flesh; and
the second. or desse-rt, of fruit: at

which thoy poured out wine to the
gods, which was called Libation.
'lheresore when the Poet says the
Rhodiam wine is grateful to the gods
and to second courses, he mean's it
was used in Lib-ationis, which were
made at these second courses3 or
perhapS, that the wine was poured
forth, and the grapes served up, as
part of the dessert.

102. Tumidis bumaste racemis.]
One 0f Dr. Mead's manuscripts has
gravidis, instead of tumidis. The bu-
masti are so called, because they are
large clusters‚ swelling like great
udders: thus- Pliny: ‘⁴ Tument vero
‘² mammarum modo bumasti.''

103. Sed neque quam multoe spe-
cies, nec nomina quoe sint, est nume-
rus] Plin'y tells us that Democritus

' alone thought, that the different sorts

of vines were to be numbered, but
that others thought they were infi-
nite: “ Genera vitium numero com-
“ prehendi posse unus existimavit
“ Democritus, cuncta sibi Graeciae
“ cognita professus. Caeteri innu-
“ mera atqueinfinita esse prodide-
“ runt, quod verius apparebit ex vi-
“ nis.'’
105. Velit] It is volet in one of
Dr. Mead‘s manuscripts.
Lybici velit aequoris idem, ᾇΓἝ]
