GEORG. LIB. 111.

Praecipue: hinc alias artes‚prolemque parentum,
Et quis cuique dolor victo, quae gloria palmae.
Nonne vides, cum praecipiti certamine campum
Corripuere, ruuntque effusi carcere currus,
Cum spes arrectae juvenum, exultantiaque

haurit

Corda pavor pulsans: illi instant verbere torto,
Et proni dant lora: volat vi fervidus axis.

NOTES.

101. Prolequceparentum] Ihave that game require to be described. It

ventured to differ from the general
‘interpretation of these words. They
are understood to mean, that you
are to consider the sire of the colt,
that you may know whether he is of
a good breed. Thus Grimoaldus pa-
Taphrases them: “ Post, parentes
‘⁶ cujusmodi sint, considerabis, ut-
‘⁵ pote quos plerumque sequitur sua
‘⁶ soboleS.” La Cerda explains them
‘⁶ quibus parentibus geniti:” and
Ruaeus‚ ‘⁶ quorum parentum sint
‘⁶ soboles.'’ Dryden translates them
‘⁶ note his father’s virtues:” and Dr.
Trapp ‘⁶ their lineage.’‘ I be-
lieve the Poet means by prolem pu.
rentum, that we are to observe what
colts the' horse produces. May seems
to have understood the passage in
this sense, sor he translates it ‘⁶ his
‘⁶ brood.‘'

102. Dolon] In one of the Arun-
delian manuscripts it is color.
· 103. Nonne vides, δῖα] It is easy
to see that virgil had Homer’s cha-
riot race in his view, He has not
indeed adorned his description with
avariety of incidents, which are so
justly admired in the Greek poet.
They would have been useless orna-
ments in this place, where only the
'force and swirtness of the horses at

is not any particular mee, but a ge..
neral description of that exercise
which the Poet here intends: and the
noble and poetical manner in which
he relates it, can never be too much
admired.

Praecipiti certamina] Pierius found
conamine, instead of certamine, in
some ancient manuscripts: but he
thinks it had been written at first as
a paraphrase, and had afterwards slipt
into the text.

We find the same words repeated
in the fifth AEneid ε

“ Non tam praecipites bijugo certa.
“ mine campum

“ Corripuere, ruuntque effusi carcere
“⁶ currus-’²

105. Ezztltsmliuque haurit corda
paz-or pulsans] These words are also
repeated in the fifth AExmid, ver. 137,
138. They are much more expresss
sire than those which Homer has
used on the same occasion:

—-·-— Πάτασσε δὲ θυμὸς ἔκάσΊοψ
Νίκης ἱεμένων.

107. Prom‘ clane loru] Thus in
the fifth AEueid:
