NOTES.

manuscripts, most of the old edi-
tions, and Paul Stephens, have sacris.
Pierius reads δασέες but he says itis
sacros in the Roman and Medicean
manuscripts, which he thinks a good
reading. He adds, that it was sacros
in the Lombard manuscript, bnt had
been altered to sacris. Sacros is
generally received, and is more
poetical.

162. Caetera pascuntur virides αι’-
menta per herbas] This is generally
understood to mean: that the cattle
which are not designed either sor
breeding, sacrifices, or labour, have
no mark set upon them, and so are
suffered to graze undistinguished.
Thus Grimoaldus paraphrases it: ⁶⁶ At
⁶⁶ haec quidem animalia domi, et ad
⁶⁶ manum servant, et custodiunt,
‘⁶ caetera, quae neque sunt admis-
⁶⁶ snrae idonea, nec sacrificiis apta,
⁶⁶ nec agriculturae accommodata, in
‘⁶ agris, pratisque, sine ulla domandi
⁶⁶ cura, libere vagari sinunt.'’ Thus
also Dryden translates it:

⁶⁶ The rest for whom no lot is yet
⁶⁶ decreed,

⁶⁶ May run in pastures‚ and at plea-
“ sure seed :''

and Dr. Trapp τ

⁶⁶ ffhte rgst promiscuous‚ and unnoted

⁶⁶ sed. Caetera pascuntur, ἃς. su-
⁶⁶ baud. z'mllscriminatim. Those of
⁶⁶ which he was speaking before
⁶⁶ were to have marks set upon them:
‘⁶ and these by the word coetera are
‘⁶ set in opposition to them.'' La
Cerda observes, that this is the ge-
neral interpretation received by all
the Commentators3 with which how-
ever he declares himself not to be
satisfied. He is at a loss, to under-
stand, what fourth sort is meant, that
is not intended either sor breeding,
sacrifice or labour3 unless any one
should pretend it is designed for the
shamble. But then, says he, these
are bred at home, and not suffered
to feed at large. He then proposes
a new interpretation, that by armenta
the Poet means com-calvos. This he
confirms hy a preceding passage in
this Georgick‚ where we are told that
the bull is 10 he well fed, but the cow
to be kept lean:

‘⁶ Ipsa autem macie tenuant armenta
⁶⁶ volentes, ι

Here, says he, the cows are called
armenta, as distinct from the bulls.
It is therefore this learned Commen-

· tator's opinion, that the Poet would

have the bull-calves kept at home,
and brought up with great care, but.
that he has no regard for the cow-
canes, and allows them to ramble
at large in the meadows. I take
neither of these interpretations to ho
