and the fields being strewcd
with wild bei-ries, Bu: the
ground which is fat, and rien
with sweet moisture‚ and the
field which is full οἱ grass, and
abounding with fertility, such
as we are often went to look
down upon in the mlle-y of
some hill, where rivers are
melted down from the tons of
the rocks, and carry a rich
ooze along with them: and
such as rises gently to 1110

NOTES.

in Syria, AEthiopia and mount Le-
banon, Clusius observ-ed it in great
plenty also near Guadix, acityin the
kingdom of Granada, as also 111 the
south of France anci Germany. It
is thought to be the Cappadociam Ju-
jubs‚ which are mentioned by Pliny,
amongst the coronary flowers: Zi-
“ zipha, quae et Cappadocia vocan-
“ tur: his odoratus similis olea-
“ rum floribus.”‘ The flowers 0'f the

Eloeagnus are much like those of the

- olive3 but the ovary of the Eloeagnus

is placed below the petal, whereas
that of the olive is contained within
thepetal. They are very sweet‚ and
may be smelt at some distance.

ver. 187. of the first Georgick.

184. At qnae pinguis humus, &c.]
Virgil here recommends a fat, moist‚
fruitful soil for vines, in which he is
said to differ from the other writers
of agriculture, who say that a very
fruitful soil will generally make a
bad vineyard. Celsus, as he is quoted
by Columella, says the ground for a
vineyard should be neither too loose

nor too hard, but approaching to·

loose: neither poor nor very rich,
but approaching to rich: neither
plain nor steep‚ but a little 1ising:
neither dry nor w‚et but a little
moist: “ At si noto est eligendus

“ vineis locus, et status caeli sicut

‘⁴ censet verissime Celsus, optimum
‘⁶ est solum, nec densum nimis, nec
“ resolutum, soluto tamen propius:
‘⁶ nec exile, nec laetissimum, proxi-
“ mum tamen uberi: nec campestre,
“ nec praece133‚ simile tamen edito
“ campo: 1100 siccum, nec uligino-
“ sum, modice tamen rosidum.''
We have almost the same words in
Palladius3 “ Sed solum vineis po-
“ nendis nec spissum sit nimis, nec
“ resolutum, propius tamen resoluto:
“ nec exile, nec laetissimum, tamen
“ laeto proximum: 1100 campestre,
“ nec praeceps, sed potius edito
‘⁴ campo: nec siccum, nec uligino-
“ sum, modice tamen rosidum.'’
These authors differ very little from
virgil. He recommends a 10050 5011;
rarissima quoeqne Lyaeo,· they say it
should be rather loose than hard: he
recommends a rich‘soi13fertz'lis ubere
campum they say itshould be rather
rich than poor: he recommends a
rising ground3 editus austro ,· and so
do they; he recommends a moist
soil, · they say it should not be dry.
Besides Columella quotes Tiemellius
and Higinius‚ 11110 agree with our
Poet, i11⁰rec01nmending the foot of a
hill, 11111011 receives the soil from
above, and vallies, which have re-
ceived their soil from the overflow·
