NOTES.

55. Nescio qua dulcedine lca-tce]
Thus in the first Georgick :

*4‘ Nescio qua praeter solitum dulce-
‘⁴ dine laetae.”

57. Fingzmt.] Servius, La Cerda,

and many of the old Editors read

gunt. The same reading is in one
uf Dr. Mead’s manuscripts.

58. Ilium] It is Ize'c in the King‘s
manuscript.

59. AEstatem] It is (estivam in
ihc King’s manuscript,

63. Melisphffla.] Servius, the old
Nurenberg edition, Paul StephenS‚
La Corda, and others read meliphylla,
which reading I find also in the
King's manuscript. But in all the
other manuscripts, which I have col-
huod, and in most of the printed edi-
tions, it is melcsplfflla.

sslelz'sphyllon seems to be a con-
traction of melissophyllm, by which
name we find the plant described by
Dioscorides, who says also, that some
call it mele'tloenu. Hc says it is so
called bvcanse tho Boas ‹lelight in this

Melissa or chm, which is a com..
mon herb in the English gardens.
Varro informs us, that the Latin
name for this plant is apiaslrzmz:
‘⁶ Hos circum villam totam alveari-
‘⁶ um secisse, et hortum habuisse,
‘⁶ ac reliquum thymo, et cythiso
‘⁴ obsevisse7 et apiastro, quod alii
(ί μελῖφυλλον, alli μελισσόφυλλον, qui-
‘4 dam μέλινον appellant.'’ Colu-
mella however speaks of apiastrum.
and mellplzgsllum, as of two different ,
herbs: ‘⁶ Sunt qui per initia veris

Palladius seems to make citreago the¹
same with melissophyllon, for undem
the title of Aprilhe mentions citreago.
