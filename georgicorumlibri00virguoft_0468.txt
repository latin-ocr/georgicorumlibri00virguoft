exist in the days of Virgil, and there-
fore could not be particularly meant
by our Poet, unless he had the gift
of prophesy, as some have imagined.
Columella, in his tenth book, has
endeavoured to supply, what Virgil
has omitted, concerning Garden-
ing. His Poem begins thus :

⁶⁶ Hortorum quoque te cultus, Syl.
‘⁶ vine, docebo,

⁶⁶ Atque ea, quae quondam spatiis ex-
⁶⁶ clusus iniquis,

‘⁶ Cum caneret laetas segetes, et mu-
⁶⁶ nera Bacchi,

⁶⁶ Virgilius nobis post se memoranda
⁶⁶ reliquit.’'

Among the Moderns, Rapin, a learn-
ed Jesuit, has written a fine Poem
on Gardens, in four books. He
also professedly treads in the foot-

⁷ steps of Virgil:

‘⁶ Vatibus ignotam nam me novus
⁶⁶ incitat ardor

ε( Ire viam, magno quae primum o-
⁶⁶ stensa Maroni,

·“ Extremo cum vela trahens sub fine
⁶⁶ laborum,

⁶⁶ Italiae pingues hortos quae cura co-
⁶⁶ lendi

⁶⁶ ornaret, canere agricolis, populo.
⁶⁶ que parabat.

‘⁶ Fas mihi divini tantum vestigia
‘⁶ vatis

‘⁶ Posse seqni3 summoque volans dum
‘⁶ tendit Olympo,

‘⁶ vare tuend0.⁷’

‘⁶ some others havepost commemoran-
‘⁶ da. In the Medicean and some
⁶⁶ others, it is post me memoranda,
⁶⁶ which reading seems to have been
⁶⁶ admitted by Columella.” Pramus.

I find post memoranda in one of the
Arundelian manuscripts, post lzoec me-
moranda in one of Dr. Mead’s, and
post commemoranda in the Bodleian,-
and in the other Arundelian and Dr.
Mead⁷s manuscripts. Ruaeus, and
most of the Editors has post com.

bridge manuscripts, which reading is
admitted also by Heinsius, Paul Ste-
phens, Masvicius, and others.

149¹. Nunc age, &c.] Here the
Poet begins to speak of the polity
os the Bees, by which all their actions
contribute to the publick good. He
tells us in this passage, that Jupiter
bestowed this extraordinary oecono-
mical genius on the ssees, as a re-
ward for the service they did him,
when an infant, by feeding him with
their honey, in the cave ‚where he
was concealed from the devouring
jaws of his father Saturn.

seS, that these manners did not origi-
nally belong to the Bees, but were
added by the favour of Jupiter.
