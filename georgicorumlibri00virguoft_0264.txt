NOTES.

Curvo Saturni denia] §atum is
represented with 3 sickle 1111115 haud.
The ancient pruning knise seems to
have been larger 111311 what we use,
and perhaps was the very 531116111-
strument with that which they used
in reaping. Both are called salr.

Relictam vitem] I have translated
it the meh-ecl 152'7185 that part which is
left, when all the fruit is gathered,
and the leaves are fallen off. Ser-
vius interprets it that which the hus-
haudman 11311 left a little before:
⁴⁶ scilicet a se paulo ante desertani.”
In this sense Mr. B has trans..
lated it :

 

‘⁶ He seeks the vino. which ho 11311
“ just forsook.’'

Ruaeus interprets it nudatam vitem,
in which he is followed by Drydeu :

‘f Ev'n then the naked vine he per-
“ secutes.⁷’

Dr. Trapp has not translated relictam .·
but in his note he says ‘⁶ relictam ,·
‘⁶ i. e. aliquandiu neglectam. Ruaeus
⁶4 renders it by nudatam; which 15
“ very strange.”

407. Persequitur vitem αίίοηιίση-ς,
fingitque putanda] In one of Dr.
Mead’s manuscripts it is prosequitur
instead of persequitur.

Giimoaldus, La Cerda, Burrus,-
and some others understand this verse
not to mean only pruning, but to
consist of two parts. They interpret:
vitem attondens to mean the cutting
oll' the roots which grow near the
surface of 1116 ground, or day roots5
which the Romans called ablaqueatio.
Columella speaks of this at large⁷ iu
lib. 4. c. 8. Dr. Trapp translates it·
lops.

410. Metita] Blessc's and melo
are used for the gathering in of any
produce3 as well as for harvest and
reaping. Virgil applies messis, in
the fourth Geongick, to the taking.
of the honey: duo tempora messis.

Bis vitibus ingruit umbra] The
vines are twice over-loaded witlv
leaves ε therefore they must be prun-
ed twice in a year. He means the
summer dressing‚ when the young.
shoots are to be nipped with the
fingers3 and the autumnal pruning. Α

41⁶2. Laudato ingentia rura, exi.
guum colim] This is an imitation
of the following verse of Hesiod:

N-Z' ὀλίγην ansb, μεγάλῃ δ’ ἐνὶ φορτία

θέσθαι.

The meaning of the Poet seems to
be, that you may admire the splendor
of a large vineyard‚ but that you had
better cultivate a small one: becaulsle
