Fertur equis auriga, neque auditcnrrus bahem..

NOTES.

In the fifth AEneid, where he describes
the som-racc, spatium is evidently used
for the who} e ring foi· we. find that
the moment they start, they enter the
εραίὶεα

“ -Σ- Locum capiuni, signoque re.

⁸ ente
‘4 Corriissunt spatia audito, limenque

relinquunt
“ Efiusi.'’

If addunt se 2‘7? spatia, be the right
reading, I should rather think it
means they enter the ring, which is the
meaning of corripiunt spatia or cam-
pum, as he expresses it in the third
Georgick:

‘⁶ --- Cum praecipiti certamine
‘⁶ campum

‘⁴ Corripuere, ruuntque effusi carcere
‘⁶ currusst

Heinsius and Ruaeus, whom I have
followed, read addunt in spatio .· which
Ι take to signify they increase their
awzjftness in the ring, or runsaster aml
faster. In this sense Grimoaldus has
paraphrased this passage: “ Que-
⁶‘ mamedum tamen equorum plus

‘4 plusque currendo cursus augeturss’
May’s translation is according to this
reading:

‘⁶ So when swift chariots from the
‘4 lists are gone,

‘⁴ Their furious haste increases as they
‘⁶ ranst

Dryden‘s seems to have much the same
meaning ;

“ So four sterce coursers starting to
the race,

(ὗ Scow’ 1 thro⁹ the plain, and lengthen
ίί CD’YJ] Pace· υ

Mr. B--- reads addunt se in spatia,
and translates it thus:

‘⁴ As when the cars swift pow’ring
‘⁶ ‘thro' the mee, ‘

‘⁴ Encounter furious on the dusty
‘⁶ space.”

Dr. Trapp translates it according to
La Cerda’s interpretation:

‘⁶ As when the racers from their bar-
‘4 riers start,

‘⁶ Ost whirling rou-mi the goal.’'
