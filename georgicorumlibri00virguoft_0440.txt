For these make wide waste, and
carry away the bees themselves,
a grateful food to their cruel
young. But let them have clear
springs, and pools green with
111055, and a small rivulet run-
ning through the grass: and
let a palm or vast wild olive
overshade the entrance, that
when their new kings lead the
first swarms in the spring,

NOTES.

Pandion, King of Athens. Procne
was married 10 Tereus, King of
Thrace, by whom she had a son
named Itys. Tereus afterwards vio-
lated Philomela, and cut out her
tongue, to prevent her telling her
sister: she found means however to
discover his wickedness, to revenge
which the two sisters nuli-(iered Itys,
and gave his tlesh to his father to eat.
WVhen the banquct was over, they
produced the head of 1110. 0111111, to
shew Tereus 111 what manner they
had entertained him. IIe being
highly enraged, pursued 1110111 with
his drawn sword, and was changed
into a IIoopoo. Philomela became
a Nightingale, and Procne a Swal..
low, which has the feathers of its
breast stained with red, to which
the Poet here alludes. Thus also
Ovid ε

‘⁶ Neque adhuc de pectore

‘⁴ caedis
‘⁶ Excessere notae, signataque san-
‘⁶ guine pluma est.’'

 

The Swallow is known to seed on
11150015. Hence the I'oet mentions
it among those animals, which are
dangerons to ssees.

inculcates this precept, that Bces
should have clear water near them 1

“ aqua 511 pura, quod ad mellificium

20. Palma] The Palm is of se-
veral sorts 3 but that which is culti-
vated in Italy 15, Ι believe, chiefly
the Date trec. Pliny says Judaea is
most famous for Palms, which grow
also in Italy, bnt do not bear fruit,
He adds, that they do not grou* spon-
taneouslyin Italy, but only in the
hotter countrics: ‘⁶ Judaea inclyta
‘⁴ est vol magis palmis, . . . . Sunt
‘⁶ quidem et in Europa, vulgoque
‘⁴ Italia, sed steriles. . . . Nulla est
‘⁴ in Italia sponte genita, necin alia.
‘⁴ parte terrarum, nisi in calida: fru-
(ζ gifera vero nusquam nisi in fer-
“ vida.”
