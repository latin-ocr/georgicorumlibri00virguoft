NOTES.

402. Calathis.] Servius interprets
calathis brazen vessels, in which they
used to carry milk and new cheese to
town. But it was certainly a vessel
not at all fit to carry milk: sor it
was made on purpose for the whey to
run thro' and leave the curd behind,
in order to make cheese, as we find
it described by Columella: Nec
‘⁶ tamen admovenda est flammis, ut
‘⁴ quibusdam placet, sed haud procul
“ igne constituenda, et confestim cum
‘⁶ concrevit, liquor in fiscellas, aut
“ in calathos, vel formas transferen-
“ dus est. Nam maxime refert pri-
“ mo quoque tempore serum perco-
‘⁶ lari, et a concreta materia sepa.

404. Nec tihi cura canum, &c.]
Immediately after sheep and goats,
the Poet makes mention or dogs3
some of which are necessary to defend
the folds against robbers and wolves>
and others are os service in hunting.

Hesiod also advises us to take good
care to have our dogs well fed, least
the man that sleeps by day should
depr1ve us of our goods ε

'to σίτου.

405. Veloces Sparta* catulos] The
dege of Sparta were famous. thus we

hare seen already Taygetique canet
and Amyclaeumque canem. I take
these Spartan dogs to be what we call
Hounds, sor we find they were used in
hunting3 and Aristotle says they have
long snouts‚ and a very quick scent:
Διὸ ὅσων οἵ μυκτῆρες μακροὶ, οἷον τᾶν Λα-
κωνικῶν κυνιδίων, ὄσφραντικσί. We may
observe also that Aristotle calls them
κυνίδια, and virgil catuli, whence
we may judge that they were a
smaller sort of dogs, than those
which were used for the defenee of
the folds.

Acremque Molossum] This dog
has it’s name from Molossia, a city
of Epirus. I take it to be that
sort which we call a mastiff. Aris,
totle says there are two sorts of
Molossian dogs: that, which is used
sor hunting, is not different from the
common sort3 but that, which is
used by the shepherds, is large, and
fierce against wild beasts: Τὸ δ’ἔν
τῇ ΜολοτἺῖᾳ ’γένος τίὲν κυνεῖν, τὸ μὲν Sn-
ρευτικόι οὐδὲν διαφέρει πρὸς τὸ παρὰ τοῖς
ἄλλοις. τὸ δ’ ἀκόλουθον τοῖς ωροςάτοις
τῷ μεγέθει, καῖ τῇ ἀνδρίᾳ τῇ πρὸς τοὶ
θκρὶκ. There is frequent mention of
the loud barking of these dogs. Thus
Lucretius:

“ Irritata canum cum primum mag.
‘⁶ na Molossum

(ί Mollia ricta fremunt duros nudan-
“ tia dentes.-
