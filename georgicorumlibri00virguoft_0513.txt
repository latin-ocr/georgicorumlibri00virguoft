NOTES.

‘⁶ Dant famuli manibus lymphas,
‘⁶ Cereremque canistris

“ Expediunt, tonsisque ferunt man-
“ tolia villis.”

377. Tonsisquc serunt mantelia
wellia] It is commonly· spelt mmz.
tilia: but Heinsius and Masricius
,read mantelia, which I sind also in
the Bodleian, and in one of Dr.
Mcad's manuscripts. Vossius also

p'refers mantelia, and observes that J

this word is written manlelzcm, man-
tellum, aud mantelium. He also
quotes a comment of the Servius of
Fabricius, for it is not> in that of
Daniel, which Ι have by me, wherein
Servius observes, that Varro called
them mantelia, as it were manntenia,
and that Plautus used mantellum, and
Lucilius mantella .- ‘⁶ Varro appellat
‘⁶ mantelia, quasi manutenia. Cae-
‘⁶ terum Plautus hujus singulare
‘⁴ mantellum posuit in Captivis ε

‘⁶ Nec his sycophantiis, nec sucis
“ ullum mantellum inveniam.

“ Lucilius autem mantella. dicit:

Mappas, mantella, me-

‘⁶ rumque, ’

⁶6-

 

“ quae Graeci μάνδυοι vocant.” Vos-
sius farther observes, that thore is
probably an error in this note ofSer-
vius, and that it should be manuteria,
rather than manulenc’u, because Var-
ro derives it a tergendo, and nota

tenendo ,· ‘⁶ Mantelium quasi manu-
<a terium, ubi manus terguntur,’'
says Varro.

Manteliam certainly significs a
toa-el, and it seems to have been
made of some woolly or nappy sort
of eloth, which nice peoplehad shorn
or clipped, sor the greater smooth-
ness aud delicacy. Our mtplcz'ns were
probably of the same sort formerly,
the word seeming to have been deriv-
ed from* wap-

379. Panclzoez‘s ignibus] Pan..
chaea is acouutry of Arabia felix, sa.
mous for srankiucense. Thus our
Poet in the second Georgick :

(ί Totaque thuriferis Panchaia p1n⁴
‘⁵' guis arenis.”

380. λΙίΡοηῐί carclzecia Bacchi]
Servius interprets Μαόηἱὶ, Lydii.
philargyrius adds, that Lydia was an-
cicutly called Maeonia, and that the
mountain Timolus, famous for good
wine, is in that country. Strabo
mentions a country called Catane-
caumeue, which is otherwise called
Mysia and Maeonia, and was re-
markablc for affording no other free
than that sort of vine from which
the catacecaumenian wine is obtain-
etl, which yields to none in elegancc ε
