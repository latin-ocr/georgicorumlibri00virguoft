NOTES.

I rather 611056, with La Corda, to
give mollibus it’s usual sense sofi, be-
cause 116 immediately tells us that the
hard ground should be littered with
straw and brakes. Thus also May
translates it z

‘³4 But first Ι counsell to con-

 

⁴⁶ taine

4³ Your sheep within sost stals to seed
‘⁶ at home.”

Resides, Columella expressly says,
that 11115 111161 15 used, that the sheep
may lie soft: ‘⁶ Dcturque opera, ne.
‘⁶ quis humor subsistat, ut semper
‘⁶ quam aridissimis filicibus, vel cul-
“ mis stabula constrata 51111, quo pu..
‘v‘ rius et mollius incubent foetae.”
It is not very usual with 05, 10 110056
our sheep, notwithstanding our cli-
mate 151655 miid than that of Italy.
But Mr. Mortimer observes, 111314ί [n
‘⁴ Gloucestershire they house their
‘⁵ sheep every night, and litter them
‘⁴ with clean straw, which affords a
‘⁶ great advantage to their land by
‘⁶ the manure, and they say makes
‘⁶ their wool very fine.⁷’

Herbam carpere] Cato says the
sheep should be foddered with the
leaves of poplars, 611115, and oaks:
“ Frondem populneam, ulmeam,
‘⁶ querneam 61611110, per tempus eam
‘⁴ condito, non peraridam, pabulum
‘⁶ ovibus.⁷’ Varro mentions flg-
leaves, chaff, grape-stoneS‚ and bran:
‘⁶ His quaecunque jubentur, vescun-
“ 101, 01 solia ficulnea, et palea, et
:⁶⁶ vinacea: furfures objiciuntur mo-

‘4 dice, ne parum, aut nimium sa..
‘⁶ turentur.’' Columella speaks also
of elm and ash leaves: ‘⁶ Aluntur
‘⁴ autem commodissime repositis ul-
‘⁶ 111615, vel ex fraxino frondibus.’'

296. Dum mox frondosa reclucilur
astas] The meaning of this 15,
that the sheep are to be housed, till
the vmrm weather has produced a
sufficient quantity of fresh food for
them in the open fields. *We can-
not suppose that summer is to be
taken here in a strict sense 3 sor that
season began on the ninth of May:
and surely they' never housed their
sheep till that time.

297. Duram humum] He calls
the ground hard, because it was usual
to pave their sheep-cotes with stone ε
“ Horum praesepia ac stabula, ut
‘⁶ 5101 pura, majorem adhibeant di..
‘4 ligentiam quam hirtis. Itaque sa..
‘4 ciunt lapide strata, ut urina ne.
‘⁴ cubi in stabulo consistat.”

Stipulafilz'cumque maniplis] For
filix see ver. 189. of the second
book.

T 116 writers os agriculture are par.
ticularly 6316101, to give instructions
about keeping the sheep clean and
dry in their cotes. Thus Cato(
“ Peeori et bubus diligenter subster-
‘4 natur, ungulae curentur....Stra-
‘⁶ menta 51 deerunt, frondem ilig-

‘⁶ neam legito, eam substernito ovi- ,

“ bus bubusque.'' Varro says the
pavement should be laid sloping,
that it‘may easily be swept clean3
because wet spoils the wool and. dis-
orders thev sheep. He adds that fretsh
