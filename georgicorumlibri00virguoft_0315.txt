NOTES.

.⁶⁶ excelsus existimabitur ab incessu
‘⁶ sublimi, videlicet, si cum exulta-
‘⁶ tione quadam excursitet.” In this
they are followed by May, who
translates it mallee prouclly: and by
Dr. 'l'rapp, who renders it zcilh ἱρῇ-ῃ

port prances. Dryden has paraphrased
itin a strange manner :

’ ‘⁶ 91 able body, sound of limb and
⁶⁶ UgiiIgil‘it³ he walks, on pasterns firm
‘⁶ and straight3
⁶⁶ {tis ¹.¹¹t⁰fi⁰¹¹⁵ easy, prancing in his
· gai . ,

Ι rather believe the Poet means only
that the colt ought to bare long,
straight legS, whence he must neces-
sarily lo'ok tall as he walks. Thus
Columella: ‘⁶ aequalibus, atque al.
‘⁶ tis, rectisque cruribuae’

Mollia crura reponit] In 1116 Cam.-

bridge manuscript it is reflectit instead
of reponit.

I believe the Poet means by repo-
m't the alternate motion of the legs.
The epithet mollia may signisy either
the tenderness of the young colt’s
joints, as May has translated it:

⁶⁶ - Their soft joynts scarce knit :’'

or that those which are naturally
-most flexible are best3 which Dryden
seems to express by his moli-9713 easy ;

and Dr. Trapp by his plicmt limbs:

Ennius has used the same words to
express the walking of cranes:

2⁴⁶ Perque sabam repunt, et mollia
{⁶ crura reponunt.‘'

Grimoaldus has paraphrased it thus:
⁶⁶ Deinde, si non dure, non inepte,
‘⁶ non crebra crurum jactatione pro-
‘⁶ currat: sed qui alterno, et recte
⁶⁶ disposito crurum explicatu faciles,
‘⁶ apteque flexibiles tibias reponat.''

77. Primus et ire viam, δια]
Servius understands this of the colt’s
walking before his dam: but it seems
a better interpretation, that 116 is the
first, amongst other colts, to lead
the way. Thus Grimoaldus para-
phrases it: ⁶⁶ Tum etiam, si praeire
⁶‘ caeteros, viaeque palustris dux, et
‘⁶ anteambulo fieri gestiat.'’ Most
os the Commentators understand this
passage in 1116 same sense.

Varro says it is a sign that a colt·
will prove a good horse, if 116 6011-
tends with his companions, and is
the first amongst them to pass a ri-
ver: ‘⁶ Equi boni futuri signa sunt,
‘⁶ sicum gregalibus in pabulo con.
⁶⁶ tendit, in currendo, aliave qua re,
‘⁶ quo potior sit: si cum flumen
‘⁶ transvehundum est, gregi in primis
⁶⁶ praegreditur, ac non respectat
‘⁶ alios.'’ Columella speaks much to
1116 531116 purpose: ⁶⁶ Si ante gregem
⁶⁶ procurrit, si lascivia et alacritate
“ interdum et cursu certans aequales
‘⁶ exuperat, si fossam sine cunctatione
‘⁶ transilit, pontem, flumenque trans.

man, the Lombard, and in some
other manuscripts it is ponti.- sor
