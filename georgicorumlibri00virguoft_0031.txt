NOTES.

aaz* ἔν ταῖς ἔυχσιῖς, καῖ ἓν ταῖς θυσίαις.
Fulvius Ursinus quotes many passages
out of antient authors, to the same
purpose. Dryden has quite lost the
solemnity of the expression, by trans·
lating it,

“ Who gave us corn sor mast, for
“ water winc.’'

Vida alludes to this passage, when he
tells us that the Poets sometimes put
Achelous, for water in general ε

“ Nec deerit tibi, pro fluviis, pro-
“ que omnibus undis,

“ Pocula qui pressis Acheloia mis-
“ ceat uvis.”

10. Agrestum praesentia numina
Fauni, 6⁶0] The Fauns and Dryads
were usually invoked together, as
deities who presided over rural af-
fairs. “ Quin et Sylvanoe, says
“ Pliny, Faunosque et Dearum ge-
“ nera sylvis, ac sua numina, tan-
“ quam et caelo, attributa credi-
“ mus.'' The original of these
Fauns is thought to be Faunus, who
taught the ancient Italians their reli-
gion, and was worshipped by them.
He was the father of Latinus, and
delivered his eracles in a grove, not
by signs, but by voice. We have
aAEn account of this in the seventh

neid:

“ mli-³⁰⁸ sollicitus monstris, oracula
‘⁸ anni

“ Fatidici genitoris adit, lucosque
‘⁴ sub alta ’

“ Consulit Albunea, nemorum quae
“ maxima sacro

“ Fonte sonat. ——— — ——- —

“ —Subita ex alto vox reddita luco
“ est.'’

The Pauus are so called dfando, boe·
cause they speak personally to men.
They are generally thought to be the
same with the satyrs. Horace seems
to make Faunus the same with Pan:

‘⁶ Velox amoenum saepe Lucretilem
“ Mutat Lycaeo Faunus;”

for Lycaeus was one of the habita·
tions of Pan, as we find in this invo-
canon:

“ Ipse nemus linquens patrium, sal·
“ rusque Lycaei,
“ Pan ovium custos.'’

The Dryads had their name from
δξῦς, an oak.

12. Prima] Various are the opi-
nions of commentators concerniug
the meaning of this epithet. Many,

. says Servius, take it to mean olim.

In this sense Grimoaldus has inter-
preted it. La Cerda leaves his
reader to choose which he pleases of
four interpretationis. 1. 'I'he earth
may be called prima, because it ex-
isted before the other elements. 2.
Because the earth, together with hea-
ven, was said to be the parent of the

B 3 gods.
