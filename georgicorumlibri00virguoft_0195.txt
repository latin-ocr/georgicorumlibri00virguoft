GEORG. LIB. ΙΙ.

Discere quam multae Zephyro turbentur arenae ε
Aut ubi navigiis violentior incidit eurus,

Nosse, quot Ionii veniant ad litora fluctus.

Nec vero terrae ferre omnes omnia possunt.
Fluminibus salices, crassisque paludibus alni 110
Nascuntur: steriles saxosis montibus orni:
Littora myrtetis laetissima: denique apertos

that are tossed with tlze west
wind, or the Ionian waves² that
dash against ihc shore, when a
Strong east-wind falls upon the
ships. But neither can every·
sort of land bear all seris οἱ
trees. Willon s grow about ri-
vers, and aiders in muddy
marshes: the barren wild ashes
on rocky mountains: the sea
shores abeund with mynles:
lastly the vine loves open hilis,
and yews the northern cold.
Behold also the most distant

parts of the cultivated globe,

Bacchus amat colles, aquilonem et frigora taxi.

Aspice et extremis domitum cultoribus orbem,

NOTES.

This seems to be an imitation of

Theocritus, in his sixteenth Idyl-
ium.

109. Νεσ ‘cero terroe, cisa] The
Poet now informs us, that different
plants require different soils ι he men-
tions several considerable trees, by
which the countries that produce
them may be distinguished ; and con-
cludes with a beautiful description of
the Citron-tree.

Half this verse is taken from Lu-

cretius, lib. 1. ver. 167.

110. Fluminibus salices] The au-
thor of the books of plants, ascribed
to Aristode, says that willows grow
enher in dry or wet places: Τινσὶ
μὲν ζῶσιν ἔν τόποις ὑγροῖς, τινὰ δὲ ξηροῖς,
τινὰ {v ἑκατέροις, ὢςῆ ῗτέειγ It would be
wastlng time, to produc‘e innumerable
quotations from other authors, to
shew that wet grounds are the proper
soil for willows: since itis confirmed
by daily experience.

Crassis paludibus] Servius inter-
prets crassis, lutosis, naturaliter .- Gri-
moaldus’s paraphrase is, “ Alni gau-
“ dent paludibus, et luto repletis lo-
“ cis.'' Mr. Evelyn says, “The Al·
“ der is of all the other the most faith-
“ ful lover of watery and bogg
“ places, and those most despised
“ weeping parts, or water-galls of
“ forests; for in better and dryer
“ ground they attract the moisture.
“ from it, and injure it.’¹

111. orni] See the note on ver·

114. Extremis domitum cultoribus
orbem] Servius thinks the prepo-
sition cum is to bc understood here,
and that these words are to be ren-
dered ‘⁴ the farthest part of the earth
“ subdued together with it’s hus-
“ bandmenl’ He supposes the Poet
designs a compliment to the Romans,
who had subdued those nations.
Grimoaldus‚ La Cerda, and most of

¹ the Commentators follow this inter-

pretation. Ruaeus gives the sense
which I have followed in my transla÷
tion. May follows Servius 2
