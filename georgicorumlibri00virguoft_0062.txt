NOTES.

'⁵ Prima. (ledit fruges, alimentaque
“ initia terris:

'⁶ Prima dedit leges: Cereris sumus
“ omnia inunus.'’

125. Ante Jotrem nulle? subigebant
arva coloni.] Thus Ovid:

“ Ipsa quoque immunis rastroque
“ intacta, nec ullis

‘⁶ Saucia vomeribus, per se dabat
“ omnia tellus.”

126. Nea] It is ne in the Roman
manuscript, according to Pierius,
whichis no unelegant reading.

127. Iu medium quim-chaun] Ιιι
medium signifies in common. Thus
Seneca speaking of the ¹golden age,
says, ‘⁴ Cum in medio jacerent bene-
·'‘ ficia naturae promiscue utenda:”
and after having quoted this passage
from Virgil, lie adds: ‘⁴ Quid homi-
‘² num illo genere felicius? In com-
mune rerum natura fruebantur:
‘⁶ sufficiebat illa, ut parens, in tute-
“ lain omniumff’

I p-saque tellus omnia liberius nullo
poscente ferebat] Thus Hesiod:

Εί

----- Καρπὸν δ’ ἔφερε ζείδωρος ἄρθρα
Ἀυτομάτη, πολλόν τε καὶ ἄφθονον.

129. Ilffalum virus] Malum is not
a superfluous epithet5 sor virus is used

in a good as well as a bad sense. The
Greeks used φάρμακον in the same
manner: thus we find in Homer

Φάρμακα, πολλὰ μὲν ἐσθλὰ μεμιγμένα,
’πολλὰ δὲ λυγρά.

See the note onvirosa Castorea,ver. 58.

131. Mellaque decussit foliis-‚J The
Poets feign, that, in the golden age,
the honey dropped from leaves of
trees. Thus Ovid:

“ Elavaflue’de viridi stillabant ilice
me a.

Our Poet, speaking, in the fifth
Eclogue, of the restoration of the

golden age, says that the oaks shall
sweat honey :

‘⁴ 1‘3t durae quercus sudabunt roscida
‘ moll-‘il’

It is no uncommon thing to find a
sweet, glutinous liquor on oak leaves,
which might give the Poets room to
imagine, that, in the golden age, the
leaves abounded with honey.

Ignemque removit] He did not
totally take the fire away, but only
concealed it in the veins of fiints.
Thus HeSlOd: Κξῦψε δὲ σῦς.

132. Et passim rivis currentia vina
repressit-J lt is feigned that there
