. 261. Porta tonat coelz’, δια] The
Commentators are greatly divided
about the meaning of the gate of hea-
ven. Servius interprets it the air

' full of clouds, thro‘ which the pas-

sage lies to heaven: ⁶⁶ Aer nubibus
⁶⁶ plenus, per quem iter in caelum est.'’
Grimoaldus paraphrases it according
to this interpretation: ‘⁶ Cum inte-
‘⁶ rim aer (per quem iter est factum)
⁶⁶ nubibus erat obsitus.” La Cerda’s
note 'on this passage deserves to be
transcribed entire, and Ι shall here
present the reader with a translation
of it: ‘⁶ By the gate of heaven Tur-
‘⁶ nebus understands the hemisphere:
⁶⁶ Manutius the air full of clouds,
⁶⁶ thro' which the passage lies to
⁶⁶ heaven. Others interpret it the
‘⁶ east and west, of which notion I
⁶⁶ speak in another place: others a
⁶⁶ cloud, which is not much arni553
⁶⁶ for as that noise is made in a
‘⁶ cloud, which bursts out together
⁶⁶ with the thunder, it seems to have
‘⁶ the appearance of a gate opening
⁶⁶ to let out the fire. You may take
‘⁶ it sor the north, where is the
⁶⁶ hinge of heaven, which the Greeks
‘⁶ call πόλον, and by the help of
‘⁶ imagination, may be called a gate
‘⁶ and a threshold. O-vid will in-
‘⁶ vite you to this interpretation,
⁶⁶ who makes Leander, in his Epistle,
‘⁶ address himself to Boreas, which
⁶⁶ blows from that quarter of the
⁶⁶ heavens, as withstanding his at..
‘⁶ tempt. But I have ventured to
⁶⁶ differ from all others, in explain-
⁵⁶ ing this passage of Virgil. Vir-
f‘ gil, Ennius, Homer have spoken

⁶⁶ of the gate of heaven according
⁶⁶ to the following notion: the An:-
⁶⁶ cients seigned Jupiter to be in a
⁶⁶ certain temple of heaven, especia·

⁶⁶ ally when he thundered and
⁶⁶ li‘ghtened.

Thus Varro, in Satyra
‘⁶ Bimarco:
(ί — -- Tunc repente caelitum

⁶⁶ Altum tonitribus templum tone„-
⁶⁶ scit :''

⁶⁶ for so we must read, and not σθω
⁶⁶ lam : and Lucretius, lib. l.

⁶⁶ Caelc‘ tonitralia templa,

⁶⁶ And lib. 6.

⁶⁶ Fumida cum coelz' scintillant omnia
‘⁶ templa.

⁶⁶ Terence, in Eunucho,

⁶⁶ —- — Qui templa caelc' summa so..

⁶⁶ m'lzc concutit.

⁶⁶ Hence I gather, that gates may be
⁶⁶ imagined in heaven, temples being
⁶⁶ feigned already: so that we may
⁶⁶ understand that those gates of the
⁶⁶ temples opened to let out the

⁶⁶ thunderboltS. Hence Silius, lib. l.
‘⁶ — - -- Τοηαι alti regia caeli.

⁶⁶ Therefore they understand by tem-
⁶⁶ plum coelz‘ ,· sometimes a particular
⁶⁶ part of the heavens, as it were
⁶⁶ the palace of Jupiter3 sometimes
ξ( the whole heaven, which 1 rather

⁶⁶ believe,
