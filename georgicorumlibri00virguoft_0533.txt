or gives laws through the wil-
ling people, and affects tho
way to heaven. At that tim·
did sweet Parthenope nourisn
me virgil, flourisning in the
studies of ignoblc ease: who
recited the verse-5 of shep-
herds, and,being bold in youth,
sung thee, Tityrus, under the
covering osa spreading beech.

Tityre, te patula? cecini sub tegmine fagi.

banks of the Euphrates, and compel-
led Phraates to restore the Eaghs,
which the Parthians had taken from
Crassus, and drew the neighbouring
nations, and even the Indians to
make a voluntary submission to himq
