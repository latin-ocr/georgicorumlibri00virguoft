P. VIRGILII MARONIS

Non ego cuncta meis amplecti versibus opto 2
Non, mihisi ling-izaecemumsinnoraquecentum,

Ades, 91 primi lege littoris oram:

In manibus terrm: ncn hic te carmine ficto, 45
Atque per ambages, 91 longa exorsa tenebo.

NOT Es,

these words to signify, that the Po‹-t
begs Maecenas 10 favour him: Sim-

‘4 mu5,” says Servius. ‘⁵ L't Μερ-

says La Cerda. But if 119 caresnlly

passage now before us, we shall sind,

before he had desired him 1ο jein
with him in the labour he had under-
taken ε “ inceptumque 111111 decurre Ia-
‘⁶ berem.’' ssy Pelagopatcntz' Ruaens
thinks 119 means an open sea, not
shut up with winds. I believe he uses
that metaphor to express the copious-
ness of his subject, comparing the
immensity of his undertaking to that
of the ocean. For he adds immedi-
ately, that Maecenas may not be dis-
couraged hythe rastness of the la-
bour, that 119 has no intent to aim
at cemprehending 1119 1111019 in his
Poem, and indeed, that, if 119 had
such a design, it would be impossible.

42. Non ego cuncta mem] We
have an expression like this in the
second Iliad. Homer, when he is
drawing up the Grecian army, says
he should nothe able to recite all
their numbers, tho’ he had ten
tongues, and ten mouths, a voice not

to be broken, and a heart of brass:

41. Prima· lege littoris oram] This Ι
expression, of coasting 1191111119 511019,
is thought to contradict the open sea
just now mentioned: hut I believe
what 1 hare said in the note on ver.
41. 11111 1910119119 this sevming con..
tradiction. Mt. Β would have
pra-’1212' altered 10 1119 adverb primo,·
and indeed it is primum in the Ring's

 

manuscript, but there seems to be
110 occasion sor this alteration. Lego
in 11111111 affairs is always used in La-
tin sor coasting, whence, as La Cerda
observes, pelagus legere, which some
write, is barbarous.

45. Non hic te carmine ficto, εἶτα]
‘4 Ruaeus and Mr. Dryden understand
‘⁴ non hic te carmineficto relatively to
‘⁴ the whole work in general3 but it
‘⁶ is plain, Virgil confines it to his

‘⁶ carry with it some kind of re.

“ probable, Maecenas had been often
