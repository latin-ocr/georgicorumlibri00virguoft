Omnia sint paribus numeris dimensa viarum ε
Non animum modo uti pascat prospectus

Sed quia non aliter vires dabit omnibus aequas
Terra, neque in vacuum poterunt se extendere,

Forsitan et ses-obibus quse sint fastigia quaeras.
Ausim vel tenui vitem committere sulco.

“ The ground all fluctu-atos with the

“ Nor yet in horrid shock the battle

“ But Mars uncertain, hovers o’er

“ numerus in the singular, and nu-
“ meri in the plural, has a great va-

“ order, regularity, exactness, &a

The subjectos this paragraph is the
depth ef the trenches. He says the
rine may be planted in a shallow
trench, but great trees require a con..
siderable depth, of these he gives the
AEsculus for an example, and thence
takes occasion to give a noble de-
scription of that tree.

miitere sulca] In one of Dr. Mead's
manuscripts it is ter instead of vel.

The Roman husbandmen seem not
to have been well agreed about the
depth of their trenches for planting
vines. Columella would have them
from two to three feet deep, accord-
ing to the goodness of the soil: but
we find in that author, that some of
his contemporaries blamed him, think-
ing he had assigned too great a depth.
Vin-gil seems to approve of a shallow
tre-neh, but he speaks of it with
cantion. He does not lay it down
as an absolute rule, in which all
were agreed, but only says that he
himself would venture so to do: in
which he seems to hint, that the
common practice of his time was dis.
