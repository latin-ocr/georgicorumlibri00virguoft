NOTES.

mentioned by Hesiod, under the
name of Hippomanes; but I believe
there is an error in the copy of
Servius, which I make use of, for
Fulvius Uisinus represents Servius
as quoting Theocritus: “Putat Ser-
‘⁶ vius intelligendum hoc loco de

ZHippomane planta, cujus meminit

mention of any such plant in He.
siod, but it is spoken of in the Phar-
maceutria of Theocritus:

ἔνὲιωᾶσαι

Καὶ ωωλοι μαίνονΊαι ἀν &psa και Soa·
ἵπποι.

“ This makes steeds mad, and this

a plant Arcadia

Cauca.

The Scholiast upon Theocritus, as I
find him quoted by Fulvius Ursinus,
tells us that Cratevas described the
plant Hippomanes, as having the fruit
of the wild cucumer, and the leaves
of the prickly poppy: Κρατεύας φασι
ΤΟ φυτθν ἔχειν καρῖἷθῖ ως ’σῚκῧΟῦ ἀγρίου.
μελάντερον δὲ το φύλλον ωσπεξ μήκωνος
ἀκανθῶδες» It is plain however, that
Virgil does not here speak of the
plant. Servius thinks he adds vero

, nomine, to insinuate, that the plant
’ is erroneously called Hippomanes,

and that it belongs properly to the
slime he is speaking os. The Poet
might perhaps allude to the tubercle

said to be found on the forehead of a
young colt,when he isj ust soaled,which
is by some called Hippomanes,aud was
sought sor in incantations, as we find
in the fourth AEneid:

‘⁴ Quae ritur et nascentis equi de fronte
‘⁶ revulsus
‘⁶ Et matri praereptus amor.'’

Pliny says the mare licks this tuber.
cle off, as soon as the colt is foaled3
otherwise she does not love him, nor
will she admit him to suck her:
‘⁶ Et sane equis amoris innasci vene·

‘⁴ lore nigro: quod statim edito partu
‘⁶ devorat soeta, aut partum ad ube-
‘⁴ ra non admittit, si quis praereptum
‘⁶ habeat.’' Aristotle also mentions
it in the eighth book of his History
of Animals; buthe treats it as an old
u oman⁷ S Story. Το Σε“ tvm-optavit,- καλού-

gil therefore, who had Aristotle in
his eye throughout this passage, says
that this slime is properly called Hip-
pomanes, in contradistinction to that·
fictitious tubercle, which has usurped
