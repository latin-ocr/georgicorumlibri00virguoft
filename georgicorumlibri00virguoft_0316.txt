tion, and in an old edition printed
at Paris in 1494. But ponti is gene-
rally received. Columella, who fol-
lows our Poet, mentions a bridge, not
*the sea, in tho quotation at the end

of the note on the preceding verse.

79. Nec vcmos horret strepitus] In
the King's, and in one of Dr. ,Mead’s
manuscripts it is varios instead of va.

mos, I find the same reading also in
some of the old printed editions.

Columella says a good colt is in.
trepid, and is not afsrighted at any
unusual sight or noise: 66 Cum vero
,66 natus est pullus, confestim licet in-
,66 dolem aestimare, si hilaris, si in.-
4⁶ trepidus, si neque conspectu, no.
,66 γωψω rei auditu terretur.”

Illi ardua cervam] Quintilian cen..
sures Virgil for interrupting the sense
with a long parenthesis: 66 Etiam in-
66 terjectione, qua et Oratores et
66 IIistorici frequenter utuntur, ut
66 medio sermone aliquem inserant:
66 sensum, impediri solet intellectuS,
66 nisi quod interponitur, breve est.
66 Nam Virgilius illo loco quo pullum
66 equinum describit, cum dixisset,
66 Nec vanos horret strepitus complu-
66 ribus insertis, alia figura quinto de-
66 mum versu redit,

 

66 Tum siqua sonum procul ar..
66 ma (ledere,
66 Stare loco nescit.”

But I do not see that the sense is here
interrupted. By nec vanos horret
strepitus, the Poet means that a good
eolt is not apt to start at the rustling
of every leaf, at every little noise,
that portends no danger. But by
tum si qua sonum, &c- he means that
the colt shews his mettle by exulting
ata military noise, at which he erects
his ears, bounds, paws, and is scarce
able to contain himself. It not only
is unnecessary, but would even be
dull poetry, to give a regular, or..
derly description osa horse from head
to tall. Palladius is very methodical
in what he says on this subject: 66 In
66 admissario. quatuor spectanda sunt,
66 forma, color, meritum, pulchri..
66 tudo.” This is very well in prose,
but had Virgil proceeded in the same
manner, we might perhaps have com-
mended his exactness, but should ne-
ver have admired his poetry. Dr.
