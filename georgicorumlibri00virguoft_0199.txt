trees?

NOTES.

cubits.--—The fruit grows in pods,
after the manner of pulse, and is used
by the inhabitants, instead of galls,
in dressing leather. The flower is
beautiful, and is used in garlands:
it is also gathered by the physicians,
being useful in medicine. A gum
also flows from it, either spontane-
ously, or by incision. It shoots again
the third year after it has been cut
down. This tree grows in great
plenty, and there is a large wood of
them about Thebais: ‘H δὲ· ''Anam-302,-

phrastus is certainly the Egyptian
Acacia, from which we obtain that
sort of gum, which is commonly
known by the name of Gum Arabio.
There is only one thing, in which the
Acacia differs from the Acanthus3
the trunk of it is prickly, as well as
the other parts. VBut in this parti-
cular Theophrastus might have been
misinformed: in other circumstances

 

they agree sufficiently. The juice of
the unripe pods is now used at Cairo,
in dressing leather3 and Prosper Al-
pinus, who had gathered the gum
from this tree with his own hands,
affirms that no other sort of tree
bears any gum, either in Egypt or
Arabia. But, though it be allowed
that the Acacia is the Acanthus of
Theophrastus, yet there remains a
great difficulty to reconcile what Vir-
gil says of it in this place with the
description of that trec. It is cer-
tain that the fruit of the Acacia, or
Acanthus, is a pod, and bears no re-
semblance of a berry. Bodaeus a Sta-
pel has proposed a solution of this
difficulty. He observes that the
flowers grow in little balls, which
Virgil might therefore poetically call
berries; though that word strictly
belongs to small round fruits. Pros-
per Alpinus has given a particular
description of them: “ flores parvos,
‘⁶ pallidos, subflavos, atque etiam al-
“ bos, rotundos, parvos lanae floccos
“ imitantes, platani fructibus forma
“ plane similes, his tamen longe rni-
“ nores, et nihil aliud flos hujusce
“ arboris videtur, quam mollis lanugo
“ parvum rotundumque globulum ef-
“ formans, non ingrati odoris.’' But
might not virgil as well call the glo·
bnles of gum berries? Mr. Β- seems
to have bren of this opinion:
