GEORG. LIB. ΙΙΙ.

Arentesque sonant ripae, collesque supini.
Jamque catervatim dat stragem, atque aggerat ipsis
In stabulis turpi dilapsa cadavera tabo :

Donec humo tegere, ac foveis abscondere discunt.
Nam neque erat coriis usus: nec viscera quisquam
Aut undis abolere potest, aut vincere flamma ε
N ec tondere quidem morbo illuvieque peresa
Vellera, nec telas possunt attingere putres.
Verum etiam invisos si quis tentarat amictus;
Ardentes papulae, atque immundus olentia sudor

555 and bending hills resound with
the bleatings of sheep, and fre-
quent lowings. And now she
destroys them by multitudes,
and heaps up in the stalis the
rotting cai-casses: till at last
they found the way to cover
them with ean11,and bury them
in pits. For even their hides
were of no use 3 nor could any
one cleanse their entrails with
water, or purge them with ὅτε.
Nor could their fleeces corrupt-
ed with sores and fiuh be shorn,
nor could any one touch the
putrid wool: but if any tried
theodinus cloatliing3 then car-
buncles, and a ffltny sweat over-
spread their stinking

NOTES.

‘⁶ Not learned Chiron, nor Melampus
‘ sage :''

In which he is followed by Dryden :

“ The learned leeclzes in despair de-
“ part :

“ And shake their lmads, despairing
‘⁶ of their art.'’

555. Arentesque] Pierius says it
is horrentesque in the Roman manu..
script.

556. Jamque catervatim dat stra-
gem.] Thus Lucretius :

‘⁶ Incubuittandem populo Pandionis:
“ omnes

“ Inde catervatim morbo mortique
‘² dabantur-'²

Aggerat] In the King¹s manu-
script it is aggregat.

558. Favete] lt isson-is in the
King's manuscript. Pierius found
the same reading in the oldest mann-
script53 and thinks it better than
foveis. Ile observes that [σπη’ are
the trenches or great ditches, which
surround fortified places, and thence

convey a more ample unago os this

mortality than fovete, whieh are only
pits to catch wolves, or for other
such like mean uses.

Dis-cana] So I read with Hein-
sius, Paul Stephens⁷ Masvicius7 and
othch. The Ring's manuscript also
has discunt. 'she common reading
is «lis-cant. Α

563. Verum etiarm] Pierius says
it is quin ellam iu the Roman manu-
script.

564. Ardentes papuloe.] I have
translated these words car-bundles,-
uhich are enumerated among the
symptoms of a l'cstilence. Dr.
llo‹lgt·S‚ who was a l’hysiciau at
houden, in the time of the great
Plague in 1665, and has left us the
most authentic account of that dis-
ease, describes the carbuncle to be a
small pimple‚ which on the wasting
or evacuation of its liquor, becomes
a crusty tubercle, something like a
grain os millet, encompasscd with a
circlo as red as lire, riSing at first with
an itt-hung, and afterwards being ac-
companicd with a vehement pain and
intense licat: “ Est pustula minutula,
‘⁴ eujus liquore utpote paucissimo
‘⁶ ocyus absumpto, vel evacuato, tu-
‘4 berculum se exerit crustosum, gra-

“ nulo
