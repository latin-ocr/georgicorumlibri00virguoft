NOTES.

⁶281. Sed siqzeemproles, Sto] The
Poet having already spoken of the
ways of driving noxious animals
from the ssces, and of the incthod of
curing their diseases, now proceeds to
describe 1116 manner after which the
total loss of them may be repaired,
which he tells us was practised by the
Egyptians.

Sc· quem-⁸] Pierius found siqnidem
in the Medicean and other ancient
manuscripts. I find it also in the
Bodleian, and in one of the Arunde-
Iian manuscripts, and in some print-
ed editions,

⁴283. Arcadiimagistri.] The Ar-
cadian master is Aristaeus. See the
note on ver. 317.

987. Nam qua Pellcez‘ δια] These
seven verses have greatly exercised
the skill of the Commentators, who
’ have given very different interpreta-
tions os them. La, Cerda contends,
that the Poet, in the three first
lines, describes Egypt3 and in the
rest, Persia. That, the three first
relate to Egypt, is universally agreed:
111611111161111)7 consists in solving the
other. lle takes the “nmis devexus
ab· Indis to bc the Indus, to which
Ptolomy has assigned seven mouths,
as well as to the Nile. Now as the
Indus dees without doubt descend

from the Indians properly so called,
as it really presses the borders of Per.
sia, and as it has seven mouths,
he thinks it agrees better with the
Poet’s description than the Nile, be-
tween which and Persia all Arabia is
interposed. As sor ver. 291, he gets
clear os that by endeavouring to
prove it not to be genuine, and ex.
cludiug it from the text. Hardouin
also understands the Poet to speak of
the Indus, but retains the verse which
La Cerda rejects, He observes, that
there was an Island called Prasiane,
formed by the mouths of the Indus,
as the Delta was by those of the
Nile. He derives the name of Pra-
siane from mdo-⁶04, viridis, and thence
imagines, that Virgil meant this island
by viridem ,ngyptzcnu Huet op-
poses his learned countryman, and un.
derstands the whole passage to relate
to Egypt. As for the Nile being de-
rived from India, he tells us it was
the universal opinion of the Ancients,
that this river rose in India, which
he confirms hy 1116 authority of Alex-
ander, who thought he had found the
source of the Nile, when he arrived
at 11161οᾶ05. Ruaeus also rejects the
Indus, interpreting thewhole passage
concerning the Nile, deriving it
from the Ethiopians, who were} cglled
