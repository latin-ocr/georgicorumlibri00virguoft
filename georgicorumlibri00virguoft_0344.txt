Varro calls this insect Tabmms:
‘⁴ Itaque quod eas testate labani con-
‘⁶ citare solent, et bestiolae qnaedam
‘⁶ minutae sub cauda, ne concitentur,
‘⁶ aliqui solent includere septis.” And
Pliny informs us, that it is called both
Tahmms and Asilus: aa Reliquorum
‘⁶ quibusdam aculens in ore, ut asilo,
’Ἰ sive tabanum dici placet.'’

The history of this insect has been
delivered in so confused a manner by
authors, that I could nicet with no
satisfaction about it, till I was fa-
voum—d by Sir Hans Sloanc, Bart. with
the perusa] of a bo'ok intitled Espe-

primario cle· ssffcdz'cz'na Tcorz'ca nell’
U ›liversitd di Padoa: printed at Pa-
dua, in 1723, in 4t0. This curious
author informs ns, from his own ob-
servatium that the Assillo, as he calls
it, is a ssying insect, in shape some-
what resembling a wild bee or wasp,
without any sting, or proboscis in the
mouth. lt has two membranaceous
wings„ w‘nh which it makes a most

horrible whizzing. The belly is ter.
minated by three long rings, one loss
than another, from the last of which
proceeds a formidable sting. This
sting is composed of a tube, thro’
which the egg is emitted, and of two
augres, which make way for the
tube to penetrate into the skin of the
cattle. These augres are armed with
little knives, which prick with their
points, and cut with their edges,
causing intolerable pain to the ani-
mal, that is wounded by them. But
this pain is not all; for at the end of
the sting, as at the end of a viper’s
tooth, and of the sting of missis,
bees, and hornets, issucs forth a ve-
nomons liquor, which irrisates, and
inllames the fibres of the wounded
nerveS, and causes the wound to be-
come fistulous. This fistula seems
to be kept open by the egg, after the
manner of an issue.

The egg is hatched within the fis..
tula, and the worm continues there,
till it is ready to turn to a chrysaliS‚
receiving it’s nourishment from the
juice, which ssows from the wounded
fibres. These worms remain nine or
ten months under the skin, and then
being arrived almost to persection,
they come out of their own accord,
and creep into some bole, or under
some stone, and there enter into the
state osa chrysalis, in which condi-
tion they lie quiet for some time, and
at last come forth in the form of the
parent fly.

149. Asper.] I take this word to

be designed to express the sharpness
of the sting.
