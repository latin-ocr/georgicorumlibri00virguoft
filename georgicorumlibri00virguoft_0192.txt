Dioscorides opposes 1110 light wines to

ther this expression of Vin-gil 15 111-
tended to praise the Rhaetian wines
or not. Seneca in his first book of
natural questions, cap. 11. speaking
of the parhelio, is in doubt what
Latin 1131110 to give them, and asks
whether he shall imitate Virgil's ex-
pression, where 110 15 111 doubt how to
call the Rhaetian vine: ‘⁶ His quod

llere Seneca certainly understood
Virgil’s meaning to be, that 110 was
in doubt what to say of 11115 5011 of
vine. But l think his authority in
11115 place not very great, because he
seems not to have read our Poet very
carefully. Vi rgil did not say nomine,
but carmine: he was in no doubt
about 1110 1131110 of the vine, but how
110 should celebrate 11. Servius tells
us that Cato commended this grape,
and that Catullus spoke in contempt
ofit: and that virgil therefore judi-
ciously kept a middle way, and mado
a doubt whether he should praise or
(1151113150 it. Fulvius Ursinus thinks
this interpretation very insipid. Let
us see now what reason there is to
think that virgil intended absolutely
to praise the Rhaetian vine. l shall
first quote the authority of Strabo,
who tells us that the Rhaetian wine
was highly esteemed : Οἱ μὲν οὖν Pa?-
τοι μέχέι τῆς Ἰταλίας κωθῆκῡυσι, τ’ἧς ὑπὲξ
Οὖῆξωνος καὶ Κῶμον, καῖ ὅγε ‘Pam-meg οἶνος
τῶν ἓν τοῖς Ἰταλικοῖς ἐπαινουμένων <ivn ἀπο-
λείπεσθαι δοκῶν, ἐν ’ταῖς τούτων ὑπωρείαις
γίνεται. The next author I shall quote
is. Pliny, who understood our Poet to
mean, that the Rhaetian vine was
second to none but the Falernian:
“ In Veronensi item Rhaetica, Fa-

j‘ lernis tantum posthabita a Vlirgi:
