about a mouth sooner than the acro-
nical setting of Arcturus: that is,
when Arcturus sets uith the sun.
The second time virgil has expres-
scd, by advising the sowing time to
be. extended to the middle of the

cording to Columella, is on the fourth

first of these times is the same with
that which Virgil mentions. The
second agrees with Columella. The
third seems not to have been men-
tioned by the Poet: unless we may
suppose that by the Setting os Bootes,
he designcd to express both the acro-

then happened in March. Palladius
follows Columella ; for he mentions
September as the first time of sow-

‘other time ε ‘⁴ hoc menso ultimo, col.

ney beans, I think, Palladius alono
has mentioned the time of sowing
them, which he settles to be from the
beginning to the middle of October,
which is about asortuight soonerthan
the time prescribed by virgil: “ Se-
“ remus sisamum usque ad Idus Oc-

tils they all agree that November is
the time; only Columella adds, that
there is a second season in February:
‘⁶ Sationes ejus duas servamus, alte.
“,ram maturam per mediam scincu-

“ Ex leguminibus autem Novembri
“ seruntur leus, et iu G raeciapisum.’'
Palladius, under the mouth of No..
vcmber‚ says : ‘⁶ Nunc seritur prima
“ lenticula.’'

Arundelian manuscripts is added,

“ Tempus humo tegere, etjamdudum

which is a repetition os ver. 213. It
