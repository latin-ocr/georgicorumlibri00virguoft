GEORG.

Intima more suo sese in cunabula condent.

Sin autem ad pugnam exierint, nam saepe duobus
Regibus incessit magno discordia motu,
Continuoque animos vulgi, et trepidantia bello
Corda licet longe praesciscere: namque morantes 70
Martius ille aeris rauci canor increpat, et vox
Auditur fractos sonitus imitata tubarum.

chambers after their manner.
But if they shall go out to bat-
tle, for discord often violently
agitates two kings, you may
from the beginning perceive a
long time beforehand the tu-
multuous disposition of the po-
pulace, and their hearts beatu-g
with war: fora martial clan-

name is rather derived from κηρὸς,
wax.

64. Te'nm'tusqne cie.] The making
of a tinkling noise with brazen uten-
sils is used among us, to cause the
swarms of Bees to settle. Aristotle
mentions this costum, and questions
whether they hear or not, and whe-
ther it be delight or sear that causes
the Bees to be quicted with these noi-

ποιοῦσιν, ἦ dm? Qo'Cor. ᾪῩΗΓΓΟ ascribes
it entirely to sear: “ Cum a mella-
“ rio id secisse sunt animadversae,
“ jaciundo in eas pulverem, et cir..
“ cumtinniendo aere, perfiet-rina quo
“ voluerit perducet.” Columella al-
sois οῖ the same opinion : “ Quod si
‘⁰ est abditum specu, sumo¹ elicitur-1, et
“ cum erupit, aeris strepitu coercetur.
“ Nam statim sono territum, vel in

“ considet, eta vestigatore praeparato

the effect os these noises on the Bees

jo pleasure: “ Gaudent plausu at-

“ que tinnitu mis, eoque convocan-
“ tur.’'

Illalre‘s quate cymbala] The priests
os Cybele, the mother of the goth,
used to beat brazen drums or cymbals,
in the sacrifices to that goddess.

busa] 'rhus Varro says the place
where we would have the Bees to
settle must be rubbed with erithace
and baum: ‘⁵ Quocirca examen ubi
“ volunt considere, euin ramum,
‘⁶ aliamve quam rem oblinunt hoc,
‘⁶ admixto apiastro.’'

67. Sin autem, &c.] These beau..
tifnl lines describe in a very poetical
manner the fighting of the Becs. No-
thing can be more lively and animated
than this description. W'e here find
represented the ardor of the war-
riors, the sound of the trumpcts, the
glittering of armour, the shouts of the
sonum, the fury of the battle, and the
bravery of the leaders.

09. Trepidanliccbello cor-dm] Tre-
pz‘elare signifies not only to sear and
tremble, as it is commonly interpret·
ed. but also to hasten. ln the ninth
AEncid it is used in this sense:
