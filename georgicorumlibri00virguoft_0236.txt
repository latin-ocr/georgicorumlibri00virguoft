NOTES.

“ aecustomed. As for their inter.

“ preting semina mutata, the remor-
*ί ing of the young plants from one
“ place to another, it is ι·ἷ(ιὶ(ἰιιοιι5.”

,Sum-eina doe-s not always signify what
we call s.‹2‹·(ls‚· but it is frequently
used by the writers of agriculture, sor
ciittings‚ Clitis„ and layers.

IlIatrem is here used to express the
earth,i1¹. which the cuttings, and young
vines are planted.

In one of the Arundelian manu-
scr-ists we have neza7 and in one os Dr.
Mmd's nec, instead os ne.

269. Ctelz' reffz'onem in cortice sig-
norm] Theophrastus says the posi-
tion of noes must be regarded, as to
north, east, or south: Ἥιπεξ εἶχεν
ἔνια των ὃειδρων τὰ προς βορροιν, και
’ἴα ῦρῦς ἔω. καί 'ra ’ωῬΟς μὲσῆμςρζανο
solnmella also advises that all tues

should be marked, before they a1e
taken out of the iiursery, and adds,
that it is ofgreat consequence to pre-
serve the same aspect, to which they
have been accustomed: “ Hanc ob-
‘⁶ servationem non solum in vitium
“ positioue7 sed in ulmorum, caete-
‘⁶ rarumque arborum pum-ipio, et
‘³ uti cum de seminario eximuntur,
⁶‘ rubrica notetur unapars, quae nos
“ admoneat, ne aliter arbores consti-
‘⁴ mamus, quam quemadmodum in se-
‘³ ruinario steterint. Plurimum enim
“ refert„ nt eam partem caeli spec-
‘⁶ tent, cui al) tenero consueverunt.''
Pliny thinks this care not to be re..
quisue, because the mention of it has

been omitted by Cat03 and adds that
some affect the very contrary posi.

tion, in vines and.s1gs; thinking that

bv this means the leaves grow thick.
er, to defend the fruit3 and that it
will not be so ready to drop off.
‘⁶ Non omisisset idun, ⁴si attineret
‘⁶ meridianam caeli parum signarein
‘⁶ cortice, ut translata in iisdem et
⁴⁶ assuetis statueretur hmis: ne aqui-
‘⁶ loniae meridianis oppositae solibus
‘⁶ finderentur, et algerent meridiana:
‘⁵ aquilonibus. Quod e diverso af.
“ sectant etiam quidam in vite ,fico-
“ que, permutantes in contrarium.
‘⁶ Densiores enim folio ita fieri, ma.
⁶⁶< gisque protegere fructum, et mi-
‘4 nus amittere.'‘ This rule, I think,
is not obserred by our modern
planters: tho’ it seems to have been
laid down not without some founda-
tion. It is easy to see a very great
difference between the north and south
side ot' a (τρο, after it has been felled:
sor the annual rings are much closer
on the north side, than on the south.
Mr. Erelyn, says, he ‘⁶ can confirm
‘⁶ this advice of the Poet from fre-
‘⁶ quent losses os his own, and by
“ particular trials; haring sometimes
‘² transplanted gre’at trees at midsum-
⁶⁴ mer with success (the earth adher-
‘⁶ ing to the roots) and miscarried in
‘⁶- others‚ where this circumstance on..
‘⁶ ly was omitted.'’

manuscripts, Servium, La Cerda, and
Schrevelius read «μιᾳ.
