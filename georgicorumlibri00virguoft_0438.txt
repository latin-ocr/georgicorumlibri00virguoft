ai'gtixiis·xit87 [believe Virgil has never
used loevus in a good sense, except in
the two places quoted above, where
it relatos to thunder. In the first
Eelogue he plainly uses it in a bad
sense:

“ Saepe malum hoe nobis, si mens
⁶⁶ non laet-a suisset,

“ De coelo tactas memini praedicere

where Servius himself interpretslccw,
stulta, contraria. We find the sanie
expression in the second AEneid ε

‘⁶ Et si sata Deum, si mens non lccva
‘⁶ suisset,

‘⁶ Impulerat ferro Argolicas violare
‘⁶ latebras.’²

Upon this passage Servius observes,
that loevum signifies adverse, when it
relates to human affairs, but prospe-
rous, when it relates to the heavenly.
But this criticism does not seem to
agree with a passage in the tenth
AEueid z

Danum:

Here laevum is applied to the baleful
light of Sirius or the Dog-star‚ which
is sent by the Gods‚ as much as thun-
der aud lightning. To conclude, Ι.
think it difficult to assign a true rea-
son7 why the Ancients used right and
left in these different senses. Those
which Plutarch has given are by no
means satisfactory ε and upon the
whole, I rather believe that by mt-
