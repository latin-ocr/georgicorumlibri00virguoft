352. Munimen] In one of Dr.
Mead‘s manuscripts it is munimine.

353. Hoc.] In the samemanuscript
it is atque instead of hoc.
354. Seminibus positis] In this

94

passage the Poet mentions digging the
ground, propping the vines, and
pruning thern. r

355. Capita] It is generally a.
greed that capita means here the root
of the tree. Mr. ss-- seems to
take it for the top:

‘⁴ High as your plant oft raise the.
‘⁶ neighb’ring soil.”

Ridentes] The bz‘dens seems to be
that instrument with tiro hooked iron
teeth, which our sarmers call a drag.
It is used to break the surface of the
ground, and may be serviceable near
the roots of the vines, where the
plough coming too near would be apt
to injure them.

359. Fraxineasqzce] The conjunc-
tion que is wanting iu the King’s
manuscript.

Bicornes] Pierius says it is furcas-
que valentes in the Roman manuscript..
We find the same reading in the Cam-
bridge, and in one of the Arundeliau

manuscripts.
