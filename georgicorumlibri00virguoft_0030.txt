7. Liber ιζ· alma Cerea] These two
deities are properly invoked together,
because templus were erectcd jointly
to them, and they were frequently
united 111 the si1nc·mystcries.Lucre-
tius has brought them together much
aster the same manner:

this place for siquidem.

Munera] Fulvius Ursinus sayS,
that, in an ancient manuscript of A.
Colotius. it is numine. The same
reading is 111 0110 of the Arundelian
manuscripts.

8. Chaoniam glandem] Epirus is
often called Chaonia, because the
Chaones, a people of Epirus, for-
merly ruled over the whole country.
Dodona was a city of Epirus, near
which was the famous grove of
oracular oaks. Thus Virgil poeti-
cally mentions Chaonian or Dodonean
acorns, for acorns in general ; those
of Dodona being the most cele·
brated.

9. Pocula Acheloia] The rivet
Achelous 15 said to be the first that ⁷
br·1ke out of the earth: whence the
name of that river was frequently
put for water by the ancients. Thus
Eustathius observes, that, as all high
mountains were called Ida, so all>
water was called Achelous. This
expression might still be more pro-
per in the invocation of (1011105, as
being more solemn3 for we find in
MacrobiuS, that water was called
Acheloi'ffi, chiefly in 0111115, prayers.
