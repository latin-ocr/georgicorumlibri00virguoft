se condere in the Roman manuscript.
2⁶28. Sz' quando, &c.] Iu this pa-
ragraph the Poet speaks os the two
seasons os taking the honey, and of
the passionate temper of the ssces.
Augustam] Most Editors read
angustam, as Pierius found it in the
Loxnbard 'aud iu some other mauu-
scripls. It is angustam also iu all
the manuscripts which I have col-
lated.. except one of Dr. Mead's.
But Servius7 Grimoaldus, Paul Slc-
pheos, Heinsius, Schrevclius, aud
Mauricius read ‹augeas-tam. It is au-
gustam also iu theold 'Nuremberg cdi-
tion, and iu two old editions priuled
at Venice infolio, iu 1475 aud 1476.

three old editions quoted in the preq
ceding note⁷ and by Paul Stephens,
La Corda, and Sehrevelius. Servius
says sparsus is used sor spargens, one
participle sor another, which is not
unusual among the Poets. The con-
struction therefore will be Prz'zcssove
ora haustu aquarum spargens, First
gargle your mouth with water spirt-
ing z't. The same Commentator ob-
serves that some read ore fave, an
expression used by the Ancients to
command a. religious silence, as ore
favete omnes in the fifth AEneid‚ and
favete linguis in Horace. Accord-
ing to this interpretation the surse

ly on this· subject.

agree, that b‘y this word not the.
