Felicis mali, quo non praesentius ullum,
Pocula si quando saevae infecere novercae‚
{Miscueruntqne herbas, et non innoxia verba,

Auxilium venit, ac membris agit atra venena. 130

herbs, with baleful charnis.

makes it a clammy caste .·

“ To Media's clime those happy
“ fruits belong,

“ Bitter of taste, and clammy to the
“ tongue.''

Dr. Trapp translates tristis, pungent ,-
and follows Phila1·gyriu5‚ with regard
to tardum saporem.

“ {ledia the happy Citron beaw, of
“ mitiga, of taste that dwells upon
“ the tongue.''

Ι take the epithet happy to be as—
cribed to this fruit on account of it’s
great virtues. Some of the Com-
'mentators think it is so called, be·-
’ cause the tree enjoys a continual suc-
cession of fruits.

127. Praesentius,] Pierius says it
is praestantius, in the Lombard ma-
nuscript: but he adds that proesen-
tius is preferred by the learned. ,

129.. miscuerunt] It is miscue-
rant in the Cambridge manuscript ;
and miscuerint in one of Dr. Mead's,
and in some old printed editions.

130. Membris agit atra venena]
Athenaeus relatos a remarkable story

of the use of Citrons against poison;
which he had from a friend of his,
who was governor of Egypt. This
governor had condemned two male·
factors to death, by the bite of ser-
pents. As they were led to execu-
tion, a person taking compassion of
them, gave them a Citron to eat.
The consequence of this was, that
tho’ they were exposed to the bite of
the most venemous serpentS, they re·
ceived no injury. The governor be-
ing surprised at this extraordinary
event, inquired of the soldier who
guarded them, what they had eat or
drank that day, and being informed‚
that they had only eatena Citron, he
ordered that the next day oue of
them should eat Citron, and the other
not. He who had not tasted the
cumn, died presently after he was

bitten ε the other remained unhurt.

“This is a verbal translation of
‘⁴ Theophrastus: ’Ἔχει δὲ τὸ δένδξον
“ τοῦτο φύλλον μὲν ὅμοιον καὶ σχεδὸν ’ἶσον

“ we find ἀνδράχνης, which is a cor-

“ findingthis passage corrupted,have
