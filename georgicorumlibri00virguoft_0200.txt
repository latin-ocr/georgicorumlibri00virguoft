Or os the groves or India,
which lies nearest the ocean,
and is the sartha—st bound of the
carth? where no arrows can
soar above the losty summits of
their trees: and yet those peo-

P. VIRGILII MARONIS

Aut quos oceano propior gerit India lucos,
Extremi sinus orbis ? ubi aera vincere summum
Arboris haud ulla: jactu potuere sagittae:

NOTES.

We shall consider the other Acan-
thus, in the note on ver. 123. os the
fourth Georgick.

120. ,Νεηιονα AEtleiopum molli ca-
nentia laum] These forests, that are
hoary with soft wool, are the cotton-
trces. They grow usually to about
fifteen feet in height3 the cotton is a
sost substance, growing within a
greenish hnsk‚ and serving to defend
the seeds.

121. Velleraque ut soliis depectant
tenuia Seres] The Seres were a peo-
ple of India, who furnished the other
parts of the world with silk. The
ancients were generally ignorant of
the manner in which it was spun by
the silk-worms3 and imagined that it
was a sort of down⁷ gathered froin
the leaves of trees. Thus Pliny:
‘⁶ Primi sunt hominnm, qui noscan-
“ tur, Seres, lanicio sylvarum nobiles,
“ perfusam aqna depectentes fron-
“ dium caniciem.''

122. Propior] In the Cambridge,
and in one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts,
and in the old Nurenberg edition, it
is proprior.

123. Aera vincere mmmmm, ἃς]
The vast height of the Indian trees is
mentioned also by Pliny, lib. 7. c. 2.
'‘ Arbores quidem tantae proceritatis
‘⁶ traduntur, ut sagittis superari ne-
“ queant.’'

126. BIediafert tristes succos, &c.]
The fruit here mentioned is certainly

the Cin-on. Dioscorides says ex-
pressly that the fruit which the
Greeks call Medicum, is in Latin call-
ed Cierium .· Τὰ δὲ Μηδικὰ λεγόμενα, ἢ
vapingo, ἢ κεδρόμηλσι, Ῥωμαϊστὶ δὲ Κῖτξια,
mio-t γνῶξιμαι.

Tristis signifies hister, as tristisque
lupini. This must be understood
either of the outer rind, which is
very bitter3 or of the seeds, which
are covered with a bitter skin. The
juice of the pnlp is aeid.

What sort of taste the Poet means
by tardum saporem, is not very easy
to determine, nor are the Commen-
tators and Translators well agreed
about it. Servius seems to under-
stand it to be a taste which does not
presently discover itself. Philargy-
rius interprets it a laste which dwells
a long time upon the palate. La Cerda
takes it to mean that persons are slow
or unwilling to swallow it, on ac-
count of it’s acrimony. Ruaeus fol-
lows PhilargyrinS. May translates

- this passage:

“ Slow tasted apples Media doth pro-
“An‘ilucbi’tter too3 but of a happy
‘⁶ use.’'

Dryden renders tristes succos, sharp
insted, and tardum saporem, bitter ,-
which he applies to the rind:

“ Sharp
