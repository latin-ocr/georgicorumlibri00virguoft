49. Quippe volo mttma subest]
Some unchrstand solo to mean the
root of the trzee otlurs interpret it

By walttre’s &sing hid 2⁸71 ilie soil, the
Poet seems to mean, that there is
some hidden power ιιι the earth,
which causes it to produce particular
plants, which therefore grow fair
and strong ιιι that soii, which is

Tamen have quoque sz· quis, δῖα]
The way to tame these luxuriant
wild trees, is to ingrast a good fruit
upon them, or to transplant them.

50. Imm-aa] Some have imagined
erroneously that Vir-gil means that
their branchos should be ingrafted
upon other trees3 but this is con-
trary to practice. Inserere arborem
signifies not only to ingraft that tree
upon another, but also to ingraft
another upon the stock of that.

52. Voces] P1er1us says that some

ancient manuscripts have voles, and
some· e‘elm but that voces is most ap.
proved by the learved.

and Cambridge manuscripts it ιο

all the other Commentators, that by

ancients seem to have used pomum not

lent fruit. Others understandPthe
