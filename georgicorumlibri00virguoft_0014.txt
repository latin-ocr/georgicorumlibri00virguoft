iv DEDICATION.

many Yea1·s held the first Place, and aequired
a Reputation equal to the great Knowledge
ancl Humanity‚ with which you have exer-
eised it. ,

As the GEORGICKS were, in the Opinion
of their great Author himself, the most va-
luable Part of his VVorks, You will not be
displeased with the Palus that I have taken to
illustrate the most difficult Passages therein.
And if I shall be so happy as to have Your
Approbation of these F ruits of my Labourse,
I shall have no Reason to sear the Censure
of others, But if they had not been com-
posed with as much Exaetness and Care as I
am Master of, I should not have ventured to,
desire Your Acceptanee of them, from,

sm,

Your most obliged
