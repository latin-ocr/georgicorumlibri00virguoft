Ver. 1311. The surgens replzyrus,
Ῑ believe, means the spring, as in G.
II. ver. 330.

‘⁶ —- -· Zephyrique tepentibus au-

Ver. 147. Ι should be glad to read

(ὅ - - -- Ilicibusque virentem
“ PluribuS...”

It seems forced to make volitans a
substantive.

Ver. 219. This line is much be-
low virgil, is a very bad one, and
breaks the context to no purpose.

Ver. 471: He seems to mean, that
the plagues of different cattle were
more numerous than the storms be-
fore winter 3 as ver. 480.

“ Et genus omne neci pecudum de-
“ dit, omne ferarum.”

Ver. 482. IVec via mortis (3ναὶ
simplex: I take this to mean that the
manner of their death was various3

ver. 496. -

“ - -· Canibus blandis rabies ve-
‘⁶ nit, ἃ quatit aegros

Speaking of the horse, ver. 501.

According to your note on this verse,
horscs were differently affected.

Ver. 513. Ι cannot help thinking
errorem illum significs some mistake
in the practice or application, and do
somewhat incline to Drydcn's inter-
pretation3 for if the giving wine was
aiways bad in it's consequence, he
would hardly have said profuit. But

)

there may be another interpretation,
which will favour my opinion, viz.
That wine, which was of service to
some of them, (or which was some-
times of service) increased the di..
stemper of others to madness (or at
other times increascd the distempcr
to madness). And this comes to
what Lucretius says inhis sixth book,
and is in your note upon ver, 549.
And the Critieks agree, that Virgil
had Lucretius in his eye, when he
wrote this account of the Mur-rain.
The difficulty was to know when to
a-pply this medicine, and the misap-
plication of it is what Virgil depre-
cates: Erroroquce hostibus illum.
Either of these interpretations natu-
rally introduces the ‘exclamation of
this line: Let the gods deal better
willa good men, (md let their enemies
only szffer by such (ι mistalce.

Ver. 536. Ι fancy contenta signi.
fiesyoczlcesl,which is a natural significa-
tion of the word, from the manner
of using oxen in a team, at the time
when Virgil wrote. And it conveys
a melancholy idea, when we consider
men drawing the waggon, in the
place of oxen. Stridentc'a plaustra
l would translate crealcz'ng ωαςξοπςς
the stridor Ι imagine to proceed from
the inequality of the motion, and the
inequality of the motion from the
weakness of those who drew them,
in proportion to the wcight they
drew.

I had marked several lines that Mr.
B had taken notice were an
echo to the sense. He seemed to me
too fond of attributing to the sound,
Virgil’s great care of conveying the
idea of the thing spoken of, by
strength of expression. Much of this
dopends upon fancy3 but I will men-
tion an instance or tWo, in which I
think Mr. B — carries this much

too far.
Georg. ΙΙ. ver. 153.
