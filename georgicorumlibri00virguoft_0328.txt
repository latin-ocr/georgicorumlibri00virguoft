NOTES.

92. Effudit-'l Itis effundit in the “ AEneid‚ Non Lib-mv, von ante

manuscripts. Heinsius also and Mas-
vicius read effundit. Pierius says it
is effundit in the Roman, and some
other manuscripts. In others it is
fudit. But he justly prescrs effudit
in the preterpersect tense, because
the order of the narration seems to
require that tense, sor the next verb
ia· implevit.

94. Peliam] It is the name of a
mountain of Thessaly, where Chiron
dwelt.

95. Hunc qnoque, ἃς] Having
giren this beautiful description of the
characters of a good stallion‚ the
Poet now observes, that if the
horse happens to be sick, or if he
grows old, he is to he conlined at:
home‚,a1=d restrained from the com-
pany of the mares. The age there..
fore and spirit of tho horse is to 'oe
diligently considered. Hence tlze
,Poet slides into a fine description of
a ‹·hariot race7 and an account of
the inventor-s of charmis, and riding
on horseback.

Jam segnior annis] Jam is want-
ing in the Eing's manuscript. Pierius
says it is segnior celas in the Roman
manuscript, but he. justly prefers
annis. Iu the cld Nurenberg edition
it is annm.

96. Ahde doma] ‘⁴ For in domo;

Nec turpi ignosce senecae] ‘⁶ Ci-

‘⁶ praises and dispraises old age.

‘⁴ derstood in two senses: either do

‘⁶ sparo his not base old age, stratis,
‘⁴ hide him ancl spare his old age,

The latter of these interpretatione
is generally received, because it is
more agreeable to the practice of the
amioum, and tho good temper of Vir.
gil to use an old horse well, in re-
gard to the services he has done in
his youth. Ennius, as he is quoted
by Cicero, in his Cato mqjor, com-
pares himself to a good horse, who
has often won the prize at the Olym-
pic gemes, but being worn down with
age, enjoys his rest:

(ί sicut fortis equus, spatio qui saepe
‘³ supremo

‘⁶ Vicit Olympia, nunc senio con-
“ fectu’ quiescit.”

Plutarch condemns Cato for selling
his old worn-out servants, and urges*
against him the contrary practice of
trcating horscs. Horace, when he*
pra-ys to Apollo, that he may enjoy
a not inglorious old age, uses the
very words of virgil, in this pas.
