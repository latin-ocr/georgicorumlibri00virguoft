And Martial, in the twenty-first Epi.
»gram of the eighth book: “

ᾖ( ΙΛΕάειΞΞ) poteras abducere Cyllaron
astro:

‘⁶ Ipse suo cedet nunc tibi Castor
ιζ equa„

These are all the passages, which I
· remember to have seen produced
against Virgil, to prove that Cyllarus
.was the horse, not of Pollux, but of
Castor. But there are not wanting
'some testimonies to prove that both
the brothers were horsemen. Pindar,
in his third Olympic ode, calls them
Ξυίππων Τυνδαριῖἲῶν. It is related
by several Historians, that in the
fvwar between the Romans and the
Latines, who endeavoured to restore
v'l'arquin the proud, Castor and Pol-
lux both assisted the Romans on
-horseback.- Florus says the battle was
so fierce, that the gods are reported
10 have come down to see it, but
that it was looked upon as a certain
truth, that Castor and Pollux were
there, on white horses, and that the
‘General vowed a temple to them
for their service: ‘⁶ Ea demum atro-
“citas snit proelii, ut interfuisse
‘⁶ spectaculo deos sama tradiderit,
-‘⁶ duos in candidis equis Castorem
{⁶ atque Pollucem· nemo dubitarit.
‘⁶ Itaque et Imperator veneratus est,
⁶⁶ nactusque victoriam templa pro-
⁶⁶ misit: et reddiditplane quasi com.
“ militonibns deis stipendium. ’' Thus
we see it was an article of saith,
,among the ancient Romans, that they
both fought on hor‘seback. In like

manner Ovid also represents them
both mounted on white horses, and
both using spears at the hunting of
the Calydonian boar:

⁶⁶ At gemini, nondum caelestia sidera,

⁶⁶ fratres,
⁶⁶ Ambo conspicui nive candidioribus

ιι ¹
⁶⁶ Veaclgbantur equis: ambo vibrata

⁶⁶ per auras
⁶⁶ Hastarum tremulo quatiebant spi-
⁶⁶ cula motuz’

Tho’ he had a little before, according
to the received opinion, said one was
famous sor the cestus, and the other
sor horses:

“⁶ Tyndaridae gemini, spectatus cae-

⁶⁶ stibusalter,
⁶⁶ Alter equo. ’²

Statius, in hiS poem on Domitian’s
horse, mentions Cyllarus, as serving
the two brothers alternately:

⁶⁶ Hunc et Adrastaeus visum exti-
⁶⁶ muisset Arion.

‘⁶ Et pavet aspiciens Ledaeus ab aede
⁶⁶ propinqua ·

⁶⁶ Cyllarus: hic domini nunquam
⁶⁶ ymutabit habena83

⁶⁶ Perpetuis fraenis, atque uni serviet
⁶⁶ astro. ”

Stesichorus also, according to Suidas,
says that Mercury gave Phlogeus and
Harpagus, and Cyllarus to Castor
and Pollux: Στησίχορος φησὶ τὸν
