369. Paterleerimcs.] TheTy.
ber, on the banks of which Rome is
built.

One of Dr. Mead's manuscripts
has caput instead of pater.

Aniena fluenta] The Anio is a
r1ver of Italy.

370. Hypanis] The Hypanis is
a river of Scythia.

Ilfysusqzce Cdicus] The Ca'icus
risos in Mysia.

371. Gemina auratus taurino cor-
nua vulta Eridanum] The Eridanus,
called also the Po, is a great and fa.
mousbriver of Italy. It is common
with 'the Poets to represent great
rivers with the face of a bull.

373. In mare purpureum] Vic-
torinns, according to Servius, imagin-
ed the Poet ιο mean the Red sea: a
monstrous supposition‚ that a river
should rise in Italy, and have its
outlet near India. Purple is an epi-
thet frequently given to the sea by
the Ancients. See the note on book
III. ver. 359.

Effluit] I follow Heinsius -;
though influit is the common read-
ing. Pierius found effluit in the
Roman and other most ancient ma.
nuscripts.

374. Postquam est, &c.] This
paragraph contains the reception of
Aristaeus by his mother, her instruc-
tions, and the character of Proteus.

375. Perventum et orati fletus]
In the King’s manuscript it is Per-
ventum nntiflentes; where flentes is
manifestly a mistake.

[nanee] Servius says these la..
mentations were vain, because they
were movet] by things easy to be re-
paired, in which he is followed by
Grimoaldus and La Cerda. Ruaeus
interprets inanes, immoderatos: but
on what authority I do not know.

376. Manibus liquidos dant ordine
fontes] Dare aquam manibus is a '
frequent Latin expression. Thus our

Poet again in the first AEneid- {c Dant*
