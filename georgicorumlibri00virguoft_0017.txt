THE PREFACE. vii

at the nobler sorts of Poetry. The long duration of the
civil wars had almost depopulated the country, and laid it
waste3 there had been such a scarcity in Rome, that
Augustus had almost lost his life by an insurrection-of the
populace. A great part of the lands in Italy had been di-
vided among the soldiers, who had been too long engaged in
the wass, to have a just knowledge of Agriculture. Hence
it. became necessary that the ancient spirit of Husbandry
should be revived among the Romans. And MaecenaS, who
wisely pursued every thing that might be of service to his
Master‚ engaged the favourite Poet in this undertaking.

Virgil, who had already succeeded so well in the conten-
tion with one Greek Poet, now boldly entered the lists with
another. And if it may be questioned whether he exceeded
Theocritus; there can be no doubt os his having gone far
beyond Hesiod. He was now in the thirty-fifth year of his
age, his imagination in full vigour, and his judgment ma-

noble Poem, which he called Grammion, and when it was
finished, it did not fall short of the expectations of his
patron.

Those, who have been accustomed to see the noble art
of Hu-sbandry committed to the management of the mean-

and Consuls had been husbandmen. His expressions accord-
ingly are every where so solemn, and every precept is de-
livered with such dignity, that we seem to be instructed by
one of those ancient sarmers, who had just enjoyed the
honours of a triumph. Never was any Poem finished with
such exactness: there being hardly a sentence that, we could
wish omitted, or a word that could be changed, without
injuring the propriety or delicacy of the expression. He
never sinks into any thing low and nrean3 but by a just
distribution of Grecisms, antique phraseS, figurative expres-
sions, and noble allusions, keeps up a true poetical spirit
through the whole composition. But we cannot be surprised
at this extraordinary exactneSS, if we consider, that every

line of this charming Poem eost more than an entire day
