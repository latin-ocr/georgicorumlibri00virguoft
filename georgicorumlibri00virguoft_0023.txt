THE PREFACE. xiii

pointed in his expectations: for the Georgicks have been
universally admired, even by those who are unacquainted
with the subject. The descriptions, the similes, the digres-
sions, the purity and majesty of the style, have afforded a
great share of delight to many whom I have heard lanient,
that they were not able to enjoy the principal heauties of
this Poem. Ι had the good fortune to give some of my
friends the satisfaction they desired in this point: and they
were pleased to think, that my observations 011 this Poeni
would be as acceptable to the Publick, as they had been to
themselves. I was without much difficulty persuaded to
undertake a new edition of a work, which I had always ad-
mired, and endeavoured to understand, to which the general
bent of my studies had in some measure contributed. Ι was
desirous in the first place, that the text of my author might
be as exact as possible. To this end, Ι compared a consi-
derable number of printed editions, valuable either for their
age, their correctness, or the skill of the editor. I thought
it necessary also to inquire after the manuscripts, that were
to be found in England3 that by a collection of alt the va—
rious readings, 1 might be able to lay before the reader the
true and genuine expression of my author. The manuscripts,
which I collated‚ being all that I had any information of,
are seven in number: One of them is in the King's Library3
one in the Royal Library at Cambridge: one in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford; two in the Arundelian Library, belong-
ing to the Royal Society3 and two in Dr. Mead’s Librarv.
I have collated all these myself, and the reader will find tlie
various readings inserted in the following annotatious, I
have generally followed the edition of HeinsiuS‚ seldom
departing from it, unless compclled by some strong reason;
and [have never ventured to alter the text by any conjec-
tural emendation, or 011 the authority of a single manu-
script.

In composing the annotatious, Ι have cai-efully perused
the grammatical comments of ServiuS, the learned para-
phrase of Grimoaldus, the valuable collections of observa·
tions, various readings, and comparisons with the Greek
Poets3 made by Fulvius Ursinus and Pierius3 the learned
and =Judicious criticisrns of La Cerda and Ruaeus‚ and the
