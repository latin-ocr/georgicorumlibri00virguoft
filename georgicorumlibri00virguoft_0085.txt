La Cerda quotes Brodaeus for ano-
ther reason: that poppies were sown
amongst the corn, for the sacrifices of
Ceres. Again he quotes Brodaeus,
and also Turnebus, who observa that
the statues of that goddess are fre-
quently adorned with poppies. Last-
ly, He quotes a reason assigned by
Mancinellus, that thore is a sort of
'poppy called θυλακῖτις, of which a
wholesome sort of broad may be
made. The reason assigned by Pro-
, bus; because poppies are eommon
amongst the corn which is under the
protection of heres, cannot be right3
because the poppy heads, which are
so common on the statues of Ceres,
plainly belong to the cultivated sort,
not to that which grows amongst the
corn. Ruaeus thinks the best reason
is because it appears froin Pliny, that
the seeds of white poppies were fre-
quently eaten by the ancients: ‘⁴ Vel

“ juxta Plin. lib. 19⁴ 8. idque ad (le-‘-
“ licias et famem excitandam: unde
‘⁵ *cescum papaver, id est, edule dici-
“ tur G. 4. 131.” This indeed shews
why our Poet called the poppy res-
cum papa-cer: but I think it does not
seem to explain tne epithet Cereale.
'This is certain that poppies were con·
secrated by the ancients to Ceres, and
that most of her statues are adorned
with them.

213. Rastris] So 1 find it in the
King's‚ the Bodleian, and both the
Arundelian manuscripts. Pierius
found the sanie reading in the Medi-
cean, and several other ancient copies.
Senius, Heinsius, and most of the
editors read aratris. virgil had al·
ready spoken of plowing the ground,
and sowing barley. linx. and poppies.
It is not probable therefore that he
should conclude with a repetition of
plowing. But the sense is vmyclear,
if, according to these ancient manu»-
scripts, we understand him to speak
of harrowing. M r. ss— has trans—
lated hiin in this sense:

‘⁴ Nor should the harrow‘s labour
‘⁸' ever end,

“ Whilst dry the glebe‚ whilst clouds
“ as yet iinpend.’'

Dr. Trapp also in his note upon this
passage says rastris is much better
than aratus.
