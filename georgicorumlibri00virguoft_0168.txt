corpure malrum] [n ono of the
Arundvlian manuscripts it is Plantas
teneras auec-inclsns corpore mmmm.

[n thesv word& [hv Poot plainly
describvs the propagation of plants
by suckes-s. l §al-,0 this to be what
Theophrastus means by ἀπὸ παρασπά-
ἓος. The suckors aro called Stolones,
as Varro tells us, who adds that an
ancestor of C. Licinius Stolo had
the surname of Stolo, because he was
very diligent iu digging away the
suekors from the roots of his troes.

of planting Avulsio, and uses avellere
in the samo sense, that Vin-gil here
uses abscindere: “Et aliud genus

This is fixing *he large· branchos„ like

Theophrastus calls ἀπ’ ἀκρέμονος. Ru.

44 This line, says [Ur. Β , has
“ very much puzzled tho Commen

44 ways of planting'sotters. The
44 φαιόνξβάαε sudes is when the bot..
44 tom is slit a-eross both way53 the
44 acuto robore is when it is cut into
“ a point, which is called the colt's-

propagctlz'on for any method of increas-

man writers of agriculture propagatio
is used only for layors. The com-
mou method, which Vir-gil seems to
mmm, is exactly described by'Colu..
meua. 44 W⁷hen you would lay down
