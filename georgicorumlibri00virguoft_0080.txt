NOTES.

Dr. Trapp does not translate oleaster
plurimus the wiltl olive tall, but

“ This the wild olives show, when
‘⁶ thiel„- they rise
“ On the sanie mould.’'

I believe May is tho only translator,
who has given plurima the true sense,
in the passage under our considera-
tion:

“ Consider thou when nut-treesfielly
“ bloom.”

188. Ramos olentes] The strong
smell of the branchos is inore appli-
cable to the walnut than to the al-
mond. The very shade ot' the walnut
was thought by the ancient& to be
injurious to the head. Pliny says in
lib. 17. cap. 1¹2. “ Jain quaedain
“ umbrarum proprietas, ‚iuglandium
‘⁴ gravis et noxia, etiam capiti hu-
“ mano, omnibusque juxta satis.’'
And in lib. 23. cap. S. he sayS‚ ‘⁴ Ar-
‘v‘ borum ipsarum foliorumque vires
“ in cerebrum penetraiit.’'

191. Εωιώεναῂ] ln one of the
Arundelian and one of Dr. Mead's
manuscripts, it is exsuperat. But this
must be an error of the transcribe1·s;
for the second syllable in exuperat is
§horn as in the second AEneid:

“ Sanguineae exuperant undasfl

192. Nequaquam] Servius, and

after him La Cei-da, interprets ne-

quicquam pingues to be the same as
non pingues: which 1 believe is not
the sense in this place. Nequicquam
frequently occurs in Virgil: but sel-
‹loni is used for not. See the note on
iser⁴ 403.

Palem] Some copies have paleoe:
but palea is generally received.

193. Semina vidi equidem, &ej In
this place he adds a precept relating
to beans: that they should be picked
every year, and only the largest
sown3 without which care all the
artful preparations made by some
husbandmen is in vain. ἱ

Ι have. interp1·ete‹l this passage
to relate to beans, on the authority
of Pliny, who says, “ Virgilius ni-
“ tro et amurca perfundi jubetfa*
“ bum: sic etiam grandescere pro-
“ mittit.'’

194⁴. Petfcmdere] Scin-evetius reads
proficndere. ¹

195. siliquis fallacibus] The
mention ot' pods shews that the
Poet speaks of pulse. The pods are
called dwez‘fid, because they often
grow to a sufficient size, when
upon examinanon they prove almost
