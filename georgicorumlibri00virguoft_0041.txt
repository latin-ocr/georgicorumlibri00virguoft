NOTES,

the Bodleian, and some of the old
printed editions have sentit. The
commentators have found great dif-
ficulty in explaining this passage.
Servius takes it to mean that land,
which has twice felt the heat of the
‘days and cold of the nights3 by
which he supposes virgil intends to
express the two times οἵ plowing, iu
spring and autumn. Others suppose
that he means the ground should lie
fallow every other year, and thus
explain it's feeling both hoat and cold
twice: they say it is plowed about
the end· of winter, it rests the next
summer, is sown about the beginning
of winter, and yields it's crop the fol-
lowing summer. They support their
interpretation by several quotane-ns:
but these prove only 'that it was a
common practice amongst the An-
tients, to cultivate their fields after
this manner. The Poet is here ad-
vising the farmer to be very diligent
in plowing, not to spare the labour
of his oxen‚ and to polish his share
with frequent use3 and to encou-
rage him, he adds, that if he would
exceed the common rule, by letting
his land lie fallow two yearS, and
consequently plowing it four times,
his crop would be so large, that his
barns would scarce contaiu it. We
have Pliny's authority, that this is
thought to be the sense of virgil:
“ quarto seri sulco Virgilius existi-
“ matur voluisse, cum dixit opti-

“ mam esse segetem, quae bis solem,
‘⁶ bis frigora sens-isset? Dryden
erroneously translates illa sege-5, that
crop: it is plain that seges can
mean nothing but the land in this
pei->saga

50. At prins, dccx] In these lines
the Poet advises us to consider well
the nature of the place, before we
begin to plow.

Ar] The King’s‚ the Cambridge,
the Bodleian, and both Dr. Mead's
manuscripts have ac: it is the same
also in Servius, Paul Stephens‚ La
Cerda, and some other printed edi-
tions. 'she two Arundeliau manu-
scripts, Heinsius, Ruaeus, Masvi-
cius, and most of the editors read
at.

51. Caeli morena] I take crelam
in this· place to signify the member,
or temperatum of the air. Thus Ser-
vius interprets it; cccli, id est aerim
and strengtliens his opinion with these
words of Lucretius:

“ In hoe coelo qui dicitur a'e'rf'

La Cerda quotes the authority os
Pliny for rendering coelum the con-
stellations; buthe is mistaken. Bliny's
words are, “ Et confitendum est,
“ eaelo maxime constare ea: quippe
“ Virgilio jubente praedisci ventos
“ ante omnia, ae siderum mores,
“ neque aliter quam navigantibus
‘⁶ servari? In these last words it
