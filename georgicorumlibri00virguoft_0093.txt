'of the sun, begins to depart from it,
and to appear in the eastern horizon
before sun rising. I must own I
have some doubt about this interpre-
tation; because Virgil never uses de-
cedere, when applied to the sun, but
for the Setting ofit. In the first Ec-
logue we find:

'“ Et sol crescentes decedens duplicat
“ umbras ε

in this Geo rgick ε

cc --- Emenso cum jam decedet
‘⁴ Olympo:'’

and in the fourth Georgick :

‘⁴ Tc veniente die, te decedente cane-
“ bat.’'

Therefore as decedere does signify to
set, the Poet should rather seem to
mean the heliacal setting of the con-
stellation, than the heliacal rising of
it. Pliny would have the heliacal
rising to be called emersion, and the
heliacal Setting to be called occulta-

“ quam exortum consuetudo dixisset:
‘⁶ et illud occultationem potius quam
“ occasum.” One of Dr. Mead’s
manuscripts has descendat instead of
decedat, which is manifestly wrong.
lglryden however has translated it in
at sense ς

“ And the bright Gnossian diadem

Mr. B--has criticised on this line
of Dryden, and seems to understand
the Poet to mean the heliacal Setting
of the crown ε “ M r. Dryden in this
‘⁴ place, and in many others here-
‘⁶ after, discovers his little know-
‘⁶ ledge os the lowest degree ofAstro-
“ nomy. Ariadne's crown does not
‘⁶ bend downward, at the time Virgil
‘4 mentions. but rises with the sun 3
‘4 and as the sun's great light soon
‘⁴ makes that star imperceptible, this
“ Virgil very poetically describes by

‘⁶ Gnossiaque ardentis decedat steHa
‘4 coronae.'’

But this learned Gentleman, in his
translation of this very passage, has
represented the Poet as speaking of
the heliacal rising ε

“ Firstlet the sisters in the morn go
‘⁶ down,

‘⁴ And from the sun retire the Gnos-
“ sian crown.''

is one of the Pleiades: the Poet puts
a part for the whole. He speaks
here against sowing too early: and we
are informcd by Columella, that it
was an old proverb amongst the far-
mers, that an early sowing often de..
ceives our expectation, but seldom a
late one: “Vetus est agricolarum pro..
