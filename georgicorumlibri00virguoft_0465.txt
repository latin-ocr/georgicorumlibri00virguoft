GEORG. LIB. lv.

Et cum tristis hyems etiamnum frigore saxa

Ille comam mollis jam tum tondebat acanthi,

could crop the sofr acanthus,

NOTES.

135. Etiamnum] The common
reading is etiam nunc. I follow

Heinsius. .
’ “ ln some manuscripts itis ete'am-

,⁶⁶ mem, which word is frequently
‘⁶ used by Pliny; from the Greek
(ζ ἔτι καὶ νῧν.” Pierius.

137. Ille comam mollis jccm tum
tondebat acanthi] ‘⁶ Achilles Statius
‘⁶ observes, that this verse is read in
‘⁴ all the ancient manuscripts of Vir.
‘⁶ gil thus t

‘⁶ Ille comam mollis jam tondebat
‘⁴ Hyacinthi.

‘⁶ and the like number, that is, a
‘⁶ short syllable being made long, af-

‘⁶ ter the, fourth foot, is used by virgil
‘⁴ himself, in the sixth Ecloguc:

‘⁶ ——- llIolle‘fultus Hyacinthe .·

‘⁶ and by Catullus:

“ Jam veniet vlrgo, jam dicetur
“ IIJJmenoeus:

But the Acanthus here spoken of is
an herb, and by comam is meant the
leaves. The cpithet mollis is added,
to express the softness and tenderness
of these leaves. Thus also this herb
is called by Theocritus ὕγροε ”Ακανθος.
Or it may serve to distinguish this
Acanthus from another species, which
grows wild, and has very prickly
leaves.

139. Ergo apibus fadi-9] The
Poet always takes care in his digres-
sions, not to forget the principal sub-
ject. Ther-efore he mentions in this
place the benesils‚ which accrncd to
the old Coryciam from this extraor-
dinary care of his garden, with re-
gard to his ssees.

141. Tmen] Columella says
limos are hnrtful to Reos : ‘⁶ At Ti-

Pinum] Columella also mentions
the Fine, as agrceable to Bees: “ Post
