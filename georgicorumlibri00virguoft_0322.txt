this last verse to be of the same co.

epithet albo is applied:

‘⁶ Ecce autem subitum, atque oculis

Ihave dwelt so long on this subject,
because almost all the Commenta-
tors have agreed to approve of this
distinction, which I believe I have
sufficiently shewn to be made with-
out any ‘good foundation. Vv'hat
led them into this error seems to be,
that it would otherwise appear an ab..
surdity in Virgil, to dispraise a white
horse in his Georgicks, and in his
twelfth AEneid, to mention it as a
beauty in the hor-ses, which drew the
chariot of Turnus, that they were
whiterthan snowz

‘⁶ Poscit equos, gaudetque tuens ante
“ ora frementes,

⁶‘ Pilumno quos ipsa decus dedit Ori-
‘⁴ thyia3

2‘· Qui· candore n-ivcs anteirent, cur.
‘·‘ sibus auras.’'

But they did not observe one parti..

cular, which might have saved thom
the trouble ofmaking this distinction.
These very horse-s, which are said to
be whiter thau snow, have the epi-
thet albis bestowed on them, a few
lines aster:

‘⁶ ——-— Bigis it Turnus in albis.”

Virgil however does not contra..
dict himselt'3 sor tho’ he admires
the beauty of these snowy horses,
yet there was no neces sit), that he
should appi-ove the same colour ln a
stallion. thite was esteemed by
the anticnts, as a sign of less na-
tural strength, than was discovered by
other colours.

83. Gilva] S. Isidore explains
gilvus, to be the colour of honey, but
whitish: ‘⁶ Gilvus autem melinus co-

to be what we call (lun. May trans.

and Dr. Trapp εον-νεῖ. ,

Tum si qua sonum procul arma cle.
dere, stare loco nescia] Vise find
some expressions like this of Virgil,
in that noble description of a horse,
in the book of Job ε “ He paweth in
‘⁶ the valley, and rejoiceth in his
‘⁴ strength: . . . . he swalloweth the
‘⁴ ground with fierceness and rago:
“ neither believeth he that it is the
‘⁶ sound of the trumpet. He saith
‘⁶ among the trumpets ha ha3 and he
“ smoiieth the battle afar off, the
“ tii-„ruder of the capenas, and the
‘⁶ shoutingst’
