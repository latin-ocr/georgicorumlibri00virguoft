P. VIRGILII MARONIS

Cinyphii tondent hirci, setasque comantes,
Usum in castrorum, et miseris velamina nautis.
Pascuntur vero sylvas et summa Lycaei,
Horrentesque rubos, et amantes ardua dumos.
Atque ipsae memores redeunt in tecta, suosql‘w
Ducunt, et gravido superant vix ubere limen.
Ergo omni studio glaciem ventosque nivales,
Quo minor est illis curae mortalis egestas,

NOTES.

Some Grammarians take Cffizz‘fflzii
hirci to be the nominative case, aud
tondent to be put for tangentur. But
the general opinion is, that Cinyphia·
hirci is the genitive case, aud that
pastores understood is the nominative
case before the active verb tondent.
Perhaps Cinyphii is the nominative
case to tondent .· and theu this passage
should be thus translated: “the
‘⁶ Cinyphians shave the beards and
“- hoary chius of the goat.’' This
sense is admitted by Grimoaldus:
‘⁴ Lz‘bycipczstores abradunt hirquinas
‘⁶ barbas‚·&c.” Cinyphius is used
for the people by Martial:

(ς Stat caper AEolio Thebani vellere
‘⁴ Phryxi
‘⁶ Cultus: ab hoc mallet vecta
‘⁶ fuisse soror.

‘⁶ Hunc nec Cinyphius tonsor viola-
verit, et tu

‘⁶ Ip‘s‘e tlua pasci vite,
ve is.”

Lyaee,

Pierius says it is hircis in the Roman,
and iu some other ancient manu-
scripts.

313. Usum in castrorum, et miseris
velamina mactis] Varro saysthatgoats
are shorn sor the use of sailors, and
engines of war: “Ut fructum ovis

‘4 e lana ad vestimentum: sic capra-
4‘ pilos ministrat ad usum nauticum,et
⁴⁹ ad bellicatormenta,etfabriliavasa.”

314. Lycoez'] Lycoeusis a moun..
tain of Arcadia. It seems to be put
here for mountains in general.

315. Horrentesque rzcbosn] Rubus
is the bramble or biauk-berry bush3
sor Pliny says they bear a fruit like
mulberries: ‘⁵ Rubimora ferunt.''

316. Suo-sque diccunt] Servius in-
terprets suos their yozmg; in which he
is followed by most of the Commen-
tators and Translators. But La Cer.
da thinks it means their pastors.

319. Minora] Servius reads minor.
It is minor also in the Cambridge,
the Bodleian, both the Arundelian‚
and in one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts.
In the other manuscript of Dr. Mead,
it is minus, which is admitted by He-
insius, and most of the editors. But
the frequent repetition of ,ς in this line
induces me to believe, that Virgil
rather wrote minor, to avoid a dis..
agreeable sibilation. In the old Nu..
renberg edition it is minor. In the
King’s manuscript it is major, which
cannot be right.

The sense of this passage seems to· ἢ
be, that as goats give us so little
trouble, browsing upon any wild
