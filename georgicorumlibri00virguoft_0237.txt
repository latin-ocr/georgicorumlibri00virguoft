Terga] In one os Dr. Mead’s
manuscripts it is terra, which must
be an error of the transcriber.

Axi] He uses aris singly for the
north, because that pole only is visible
to us-

273. Collibus, an plano, &c.]
Here the poet shews the different way
of planting aplain or a hill. In a
plain, the vines are td be planted close,
but on a hill they are to be kept at
greater distances. He then compares
a well planted vineyard to an army
drawn up in form of battle.

Vitem] The common reading is
vites: but I prefer vitem, as Ι find it
iu the Cambridge, the Bodleian, and
s in one of the Arundelian manu-
scripts. Pierius says it is vitem in the
Medicean, and in several other an-
cient manuscripts. Heinsius also reads

vitem.

275. Densa] The adjective densa
is put here adverbially sor dense.

In denso non segnior ubera] Denso
is generally thought to ‘agree with
ubere.- so that the construction must
be Bacchus non est segnior 2'71 denso
ubere. But then what is meant by
in denso ubere 2 ,, Grimoaldus explains
it parvis intervallis positae in ubere
loetoque et campestri solo.- but-then
virgil should have said densus non
segnior ubere Bacchus. Ruaeus inter-
prets it in denso agro, taking ubere
and agro to meanthe same 3 which, Ι
believe, cannot be proved. Dr. T ra pp

“ says denso ubere, i. e. dense consito,
‘⁶ thick planted. The context neces.⁵
“ sax-ily requires that construction:
‘⁶ tho’ none of the Commentators but
‘4 De La Cerda, seem to have under.
‘⁶ stood it.” ssut La Corda does not
seem to join denso with ubere ,· for his
explication of the words in question is
‘⁶‘ nam haec densitas, et consertio vi-
‘⁶ tium nihil impediet, quo minus ser.
‘⁴ tilissime proveniant vina.” His
note is upon non segnior ubere Bac-

chum which he compares with

‘⁴ Non segnior agris
‘⁶ Emer-gitque Ceres, nec segnior-
“ ubere Pallas.”

 

Here is no mention os denso, and it is
plain that ubere is the ablative case
after the adjective segnior, and not
after the preposition in. I take the
construction to be Bacchus non est
segnior. ubere, in (Iamo, where denso
is put as a substantive, and means
the same, as in denso 0rde·ne.· which
I take to be La Cerda‘s meaning.

Uber occurs so frequently in Vir-
gil, that it may not be amiss to con-
sider all the senses, in which he has
used it. In the fifth AEneid, it is used
for the broast of a woman z
