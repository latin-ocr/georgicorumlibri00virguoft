ing to Pliny: ‘⁶ Numidae vero No-
‘⁶ mades, a permutandis pabulis:
“ mapalia sua, hoc est domus, plau-
‘⁶ stris circumferentes.'' Sallust also
gives an account of the origin of these
Numidians, aud describes their ma-
palia or tents. He tells us that, ac.
cording to the opinion of the Afri-
cans, Hercules died in Spain, upon
which his army, that was composed
of divers nations, dispersed and set-
ned colonies in several places. The
Medes, Persians, and Armenians,
passed over into Africa, and possessed
those parts, which were nearest the
Tyrrhene sea. The Persians settling
more within the ocean, and finding
no timber in their own country, and
‚having no opportunity of trading
with Spain, on account ot' the large-
ness of the sea between them, and of
their not understanding each other’s
language, had no ¹other way of
making houses than by turning the
keels of their vessels upwards, and
living under the shelter of them.
They intermarried with the Ga‘tuli,
and because they often changed their
seats, according to the differe-nce of
pasture, they called themselves Nu.
mz‘clz‘ans. He adds that even in his
time the wandering Numidians made
· their houses or tents with long bend-
ing roofs, like hulks of ships, which
they call mapalia. ‘⁵ Sed postquam
