GEORG. LIB. Ι.

Omnia ventorum concurrere proelia vidi,

Quae gravidam late segetem ab radicibus imis
Sublime expulsam eruerent: ita turbine nigro 320
Ferret hyems culmumque levem, stipulasque volantes .
Saepe etiam immensum caelo venit agmen aquarum 3
Et foedam glomerant tempestatem imbribus atris
Collectae ex alto nubes: ruit arduus aether,

May understood it in the same sense

gage, and tear up the lieavy
corn by the very roots far and
near, and toss it on high, just
as a black whirlwind would
carry away the light straw,
and flying stubble. Often also
an immense flood of waters
falls from the 11eavens‚vand
clouds gathered out ol the deep
thicken the tem pest with black-
sliowers: the lofty sky pours
down,

318. Concurrere] Itis consurgere
ln one of Dr. Mead's manuscripts,
and in the Roman manuscript, ae-
cording to Pierius. But concurrere
is a better word: and wehave the air-
thority of Pliny that it is the word
which Virgil used in this place:
‘⁶ Etenim praedicta ratione vento-
‘⁶ rum, nn saepius eadem dicantur,
‘⁶ transire convenit ad reliqua tem-
‘⁶ pestatum p1aesagiav, quoniam ct
‘⁶ hoc placuisse Virgilio magnopere
‘⁶ video. Siquidem in ipsa messe
‘⁶ saepe concurrere pradia ventorum
ὅ( damnosa imperitis refert.”

320. Italurbz'ne nigro, [Se] This
no doubt is to be understood as a si.
mile. The Poet, to magnisynthe
storm heis describing, represents it
as whirling alost the heavy corn with
its ears and rents, just as an ordinary
whirlwind would toss some light
empty straw. Ruaeus seems to take
the whirling up os the lightstraw to
be a part of' Virgil’s storm: “ Quae
‘⁶ dissiparent in auras plenam segetem
ᾖ( extirpatam radicitus, tam denso

The two following lines are hardly
intelligime, and have nothing but the
word hyems in virgil, to give them
any sort of countenance.''

‘⁶ With such a force the flying rack

winter wears the face

‘⁶ of heav'n.'’

Dr. Trapp translates it as if by ita
turbine was meant tale· turbine .·

vius thinks that by ex alto is meant
from the north3 because that pole
appears clevated to us.
aeusjustly observes, storms generally
come from the south3 and the Poet
