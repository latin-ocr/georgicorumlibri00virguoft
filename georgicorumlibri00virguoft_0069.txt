and other warin countries. It is the
name also of an instrument used in
war, to nnnoy the horso. This in-
strument has τρεῖς βολὰς, three mike-3,
whence the Greek name τρίέολος is
derived,

This fiction of the Pom, that Ju-
piter caused the earth to produce
these prickly weeds, seems to have
been borrowed from Moses. We are
told in the third chapter of Genesis,
that when God cursed the earth, he
said it should brino sorth thot-ns aml
thistles. as it is in our translation.

Lolium or Darnel is a common wecd
in our corn fields. The wild oats are
no les-3 frequent in many places.

They are not the common oats dege*
nerated b) growing wild3 but a,
quite differem species: the chaff of
them is hairy, and the seed is small,
like that of grass. lt was the gene-
rul opinion of the ancients that wheat
and barley ‹lega-noram! into these
weeds: but they are specifically dis·
ferent, and rise from their own secds.
'l'he word dominantur is very proper;
for these weeds grow so tall, that they
overtop the corn.

nculnr injunction to avoid the plagues
which he mentioned about the bogiss—

says, that in the Medieean manu·
script, instead of terram insectabere
rastrix, it is herbam insectabere rastris .-

manuscript. He says the birds are to
be seared away, because geese and
