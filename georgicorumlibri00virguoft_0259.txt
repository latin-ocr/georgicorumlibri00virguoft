But what harm is it to the vineyards
if the rocks are split or burnt with
heat? I take the poet’s meaning to
be, that vineyards plhnted on a rocky
soil, which therefore suffer most in
dry weather, are not so much injured
by the most scorching heat, as by the
biting of cattle. The poet mentions
vineyards being planted in rocks, in
ver. 520.

‘⁶ —————— Et alte
‘⁶ Mitis in apricis coquitur vindemia
⁶⁶ saxis.”

310. Non aliam ob culpam Baccho
caper omnibns aris creditura] In one
of the Arundelian manuscripts we
have causam instead of culpam, but
culpam is more poetical.

This seems to be taken from Varro
who tells us, that the bite of goats
poisons the vines and olives, for
which reason goats are sacrificed
to Bacchus, by way of punishment
sor their crime: ⁶⁶ Quaedam enim pe-
‘⁶ eudes culturae sunt inimicae, ac
'⁶⁶ veneno, ut istae, quas dixisti, cct-
‘⁶ prae. Eae enim omnia novella
“sata carpendo corrumpunt, non
⁶⁶ minimum vites, atque oleas, Ita-
‘⁶ que propterea institutum diversa de
⁶⁶ causa, ut ex caprino genere ad ‚alii
⁶⁶ dei aram hostia adduceretur, ad
⁶⁶ alii non sacrificaretur, cum ab eo-
‘⁶ dem odio alter videre nollet, alter
‘⁶ etiam videre pereuntem vellet.
‘⁶ Sic factum, utIAbero patri repertori
⁶⁶ vitis hirci immolarentur, proinde

Contra ut
Minervae caprini generis nihil im,
molarent, propter oleam, quod
eam, quam laeserit, fieri dicunt
· sterilem. Ejus enim salivam esse
⁶⁶ fructui venenum.''

381. Proscenia] ⁶⁶ The ancient
theatre was a semicircular building,
· appropriated to the acting ot'
⁶⁶ plays, the name being derived

rower, as they came nearer the
⁶⁶ centre of the theatre, and these
were all disposed about the circum..
‘⁶ serence of the the-atre. 2. The
⁶⁶ orchestra, so called from Ξρχεῒσὲαι,
‘⁶ to (lancet it was the inner part, or
· centre of the theatre, and the
lowest of all, and hollow, whence
⁶⁶ the whole open space of the theatre
⁶⁶ was called cavea. Here sat the
⁶⁶ senators, and here were the dancers
⁶⁶ and musick: 3. The proscenium,
⁶⁶ which was a place drawn from one
⁶⁶ horn of the theatre to the other,
‘⁶ between the orchestra and the
⁶⁶ scene, being higher than the or·-
⁶⁶ chestra‚ and lower than the scene:
⁶⁶ here the comic and tragic actors
‘⁶ spoke and acted upon an elevated
‘⁶ place which was called the pul.
⁶⁶ picum, or stage. 4. The scene was
⁶⁶ the opposite part to the audience 3
⁶⁶ decorated with pictures and co-
⁶⁶ lumns.
