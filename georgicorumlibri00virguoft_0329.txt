Ingratum ¹trahit ε et, si quando ad proelia ven-

and vainly tuggs at the un*-
grateful labour, and is 'ue ever
attempts to engage, he rages
impotently‚ as a great fire
sometimes rag-es without force,

Ut quondam in stipulis magnus sine viribus ignis

N OTES

- ‘4 Frui paratis, et valido mihi,

,1 ‘⁵ Latoe, dones: et precor, integra
ἑ, ‘⁶ Cum mente, nec turpem senectam
‘⁶ Degere, nec cithara carentem.”

ovid, lamenting the misfortunes which
attended his old age, says it fares
otherwise with an old victorious horso,
'who is suffered to graze quietly in
the meadows:

“ Ne cadat, et multas palmas inho-
“ nestet adeptas,
‘⁶ Languidus in pratis gramina car.
‘⁶ pit equuS.'’

⁷ May’s translation is according to the
first interpretation:

ὅ( Yet when disease or age have
ν ·“ brought to nought ⁷

·“ This horse's spirit, let him at home
· ‘⁶ be wrought,

‘⁶ Nor spare his base old age.’>

·-Dryden follows the latter interpreta-
tion, and adds a large paraphrase:

<“ But worn with years, when dire
“ diseases come,

‘⁶‘ Then hide his not ignoble age at

· ‘⁶ home:

>“ In peace t’ enjoy his former palms
‘⁶ and palus,

.“ And gratesuuy be kind to his re.

= “ mains.”

ι ξῦν. ‘Trapp also follows the latter in-
terpretation ε

“ When weakon’d by disease, or.
‘4 years, he faits,

“ Indulge him, hous'd; and mindftd,
‘4 of the past,

“ Excuse his negt dishonourable agel)

97. F rigz‘clzcs in Venerem seniora]
In the K‘mg's manuscript it is frigidus
in Venerem est senior.

98. Proelia] La Cerda thinks
the Poet speaks of the horse⁷s unfit..
ness for ⁷war: but surely he means
the battles of Venus, not those of·
Mars. In the same sense he uses
bella in the eleventh AEneid.

‘⁴ At non in Venerem segnes, noctur.
‘⁶ naque bella.’'

99. Quondam] Itis not always
used to signify any determinate time.
Here ἶ take it to mean only some-
times, as it is used also in the fourth
Georgick:

‘4 Frigidus ut quondam sylvis im„
‘⁴ murmurat Auster;'' ·

And in the second AEueid:

(ί

 

Nee soli poenas dant san.
“ guine Teucri: ’

“ Quondam etiam victis redit in p'rae.
‘⁶ cordia virtus, ·

’ ‘³ Victoresque cadunt Danai.” ’
