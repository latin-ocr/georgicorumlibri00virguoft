18. Cerasis] Cherries were a new
fruit amongst the Romans in Virgil⁷s
time. Plinytells usthey werebrought
from Pontus, by Lucullus9' after he
had subdued Mithridates: ί16911151
“ 31119 victoriam Mithridaticam L.
“ Luculli non suere in Italia. Ad
“ urbis annum nchxx. Is primum
‘⁶ vexit e Ponto, annisque cxx trans
‘⁶ Oceanum in Britanniam usque
‘⁶ pervenere. ’'

Ulmis] Elms were 111 great re-
quest amongst the 3119191115, they be-
ing preferred before all other trees
for props to their vines. Hence we
find frequent mentiones them amongst
the Poets.

Parnassia Laurus. ] The finest bay.
trees grew on mount Parnassus, ac-
eording to Pliny: ‘⁶ Spectatissima· in

(ί 11101119 Ρ31113550.” Ι have endea-
voured to prove, in the note 011 ver.
306, of the first Georgick, that the
bay, and not the laure1‚ is the Laurus
of 1119 3119191115. Ι shall add in this
place, that the. laurel is not so apt 10
propagate itself hy suckers as the bay.

ΞΟ. Hos natura modos primum cle-
din] By this the Poet means, that
these are the way5‚ by which trees are
naturally propagated, without the as.
sistance. of art.

between a tree and a shrub 15, that
the tree rises from the root, with a
single trunk7 and the shrub divides it-
sels into branchos, as soon as it rises
from 1119 ioot. Thus Theophrastus:
Δε νὲξον μεν ἷι ·:1 ἒςι το avo ρῖζης 'aoros-{hs -ι

mentioned the several ways by which
plants naturally propagate their spe-
cies; 119 now proceeds to mention
those methods, which are used by
human industry. These are by suck-
915, sens, layerS‚ cuttings, pieces of
the cleft wood, and ingrafting.

Pierius says it is viam in the Lom-
bard manuscript. If 11115 reading be
admitted the passage must be ren-
