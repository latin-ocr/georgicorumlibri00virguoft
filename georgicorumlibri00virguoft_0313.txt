Atque aliam ex alia generando suffice prolem.

NOTES.

{hey are not fit for breeding after ten,
nor before two: ‘⁶ Cum excesserint
⁶⁶ anuos decem, foetibus inutiles sunt.
‘⁶ Rursus minores bimis iniri non
⁶⁶ oportet. Si ante tamen concepe-
“ rint, partum earum removeri pla-
‘⁴ cet, ac per triduum, ne laborent,
‘⁶ ubera exprimi, postea mulctra
‘⁶ prohiberi.’' Palladius says they
breed from three to ten: ‘⁶ AEtatis
‘⁶ maxime trimae, quia usque ad de-
⁶⁶ cennium foetura ex his procedet
‘⁶ utilior. Nec ante aetatem trimam
‘⁶ tauros his oportet admitti.’'

63. Superat gregibus dum laetaju-
⁴berilus, solve maresa] Pierius says it
is juventas in the Medicean, and iu
most of the ancient manuscripts. The
common reading is juventus.

“· Servius takes this passage to relate
to the female53 but the Poet speaks

’ here of putting them early to breed,

'whereas he had before said that a cow
should not breed before she was four
years old, which is rather a later age
thanis generally-prescribed. I take
the loeta juventas, and the mitte in
Venerem pecuaria primus to relate

to the males, which he would have ’

early admitted to the semales. Pal·
ladius says the bulls should be very
young, and gives the marks of such as

: ure good ς “ Nunc tauros quoque,

(ι’ comparabit, aut his signis a tenera
‘⁶ aetate summittet. Ut sint alti,
‘⁶ atque ingentibus membris, aetatis
⁶⁶ mediae, et magis quae juventute
“ minor est, quam quae declinet iu
“ senium. Torva facie, parvis cor-
“ nibus, torosa, vastaque cervice,
‘⁶ ventre substrict0.” Columella says
a bull ought not to be less than four,
or more than twelve years old: ⁶⁶ Ex'
“ his qui quadrimis minores sunt,
‘⁴ majoresque quarn duodecim anno-

“⁶ rum, prohibentur admissura: illi

⁶⁶ quoniam quasi puerili aetate semi-J
“ nandis armentis parum habentur
‘⁶ idonei: hi, quia senio suut effoeti.’⁵

65. quffice] Inone of the Arun-
delian manuscripts it is confice.

69. Sempererunt, quarum mutari
corpora malis] In oue of Dr. Mead's'
manuscripts it is enim instead oferunt.
In the same manuscript, as also in
the King's and in the Cambridge
manuscripts, and iu some of the old
printed editions„it ls mavis instead of
malis. Pierius reads mavis ,· but he'
says it is malis in the ancient copies,
and thinks this reading more elegant.

Columella says the best breeders
are to be pickt out every year, aud
the old and barren cows are to be re- y
moved, and applied to the labour of
the plough: ‘⁶ Sed et curandum est
‘⁶ omnibus annis in hoc aeque, atque
