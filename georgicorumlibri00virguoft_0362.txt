⁶⁶ ——- Tu post carecta latebas:

From which passnge we can gather
no morenthan tna those planis grew
clo-e' enough fngcther for a person
to concpal himself behind them.
Catullus mentions tho, carex along

with the juncus, as being used to
thatch a poor cottage:

‘⁶ Hunc ego juvenes locum, villu.
“ lamque palustrem,

‘4 Tectam vimine junceo, cambisque
‘⁶ maniplis,

“ Quercus arida, rustica conformata
“ securi

‘⁵ Nutrivi.’'

Columella mentions the carex toge-
ther with sern, and tells what senson
is bost to destroy tlwm: “Filix
⁶! quoquo, aut carex ubicunque nas-
‘⁶ citur, Augusto mense rect'e extir-
(ί natur, melius tamen circa Idus
‘⁶ Julias {wie canicula} exortum.”
Since there-foro it is dissicult to detor-
minc what the carex is, from what
the Ancients have said of it3 we
must depend upon the authority

of Anguillara‚ who assures us that
about Padua aad Vincenza thoy call
a sort oi raah, curete, which §coms
to be *hc olrl word carex modornizecl.
Caspar §wlsinus says iffi is tha* sort of
rush which he has called le‘zczcs
(tentus panicula sparsa. It is there-
sore our common hurd rmh, which
grows in pastures, and by way sides,
in a moist soila It is mor(² solid,
hard, and prickly at the point,
than our common soft rusb, which
seems to be what the ancients called
juncus.

232. Irasci in cornua, δια] Thus
also in the twelfth AEneid:

⁶⁴ Mugitus veluti cum prima in praelia

‘⁶ taurus
‘⁶ Terrificos ciet, atque irasci in

4⁵ cornua tentat,
⁶⁶ Arboris obnixus trunco, ventosque

‘⁶ lacessit
‘⁶ Ictibus, et sparsa acl pugnam pro.

§⁴ ludit arena.''

234. Et.] Pierius says it is aut in
the Roman manuscript, but he does
not approve of it.

235. Recwtoe] Fulvius Uminus
says it is refcctoe in the old Colotian
manuscript. Heinsius acknowledges
the same reading, in which heis fol,
lowcd by MasviciuS.
