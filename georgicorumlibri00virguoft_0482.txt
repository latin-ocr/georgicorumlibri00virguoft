p Ingens Lydia] Lydia was a re-
gion of Asia minor, famous for their
rich King Croesus, and their golden
river Pactolus.

211. Populi Parthorum] Par-
thia was a region of Asia, bounded on
the west by Media, on the north by
Hyrcania, on the east by Ariana,
and on the south by the (lescrts of
Carmania. These people arc rc-
ported to have been so submissive to
their King, as to kiss his foot, and
to touch the ground with their
mouths, when they approached him.

Medus Hydaspes] The Hydaspes,
of which we find such abundant men-
tion among the ancient writers, was
a river of India. But here Virgil
seems to spcak of a Mediam river of
the same name, which however I do
not find mentioued by any of tho
ancient Ceographcrs. Servius says
εκμη551γ it is a river of Media, but
on uhz· t authority I (lo not know.
L a Gelda srjs that tho Poct justly
calls this riur Medim, because it
washes Media before it emptius it' s

sels into the Indus. If this were true,
it would have been a river of too
much consequence, to be passed over
in silence, as it inust {low through a
greater extent os land than the In-
dus itself. ssut no such river seems
to be known by any Geographcr,
either ancient or modern. Ruaeus
says that virgil is singular in placing
this river in Media, which I believe
is truc. But Catrou, in his note on
this passage, says the Hydaspes was
a river of Persia, and gives us a cau-
tion, not to confound this river with
the Indian Hydaspes: ‘⁶ L’Hydaspe
‘⁶ etoit un fleuve de Perse, peu
‘⁶ eloigne de la ville de Susa, l'une
“ des capitales de la Perse. Il ne
“ saut pas confoudre ce fleuve Hy-
‘⁶ (laspe avec un autre de meme
‘⁶ nom, qui sut daus les Indos, le
‘⁶ terme (les conquetas d'Alexantlre.’²
Ι nish this learned Fathcr had sa..
voured us with some good authority
to support what he says. The river
meant by him seems to be the Cho..
aspes, which perhaps Virgil might,
with a poetical liberty, call the Hy-
daspes of the Medes. This river
rising in Media flows throughSusiana,
near the city Susa, one of the capi-⁷
tals of the Persian empire. 'l‘he
water of it was so very famous,
that according to Plutarch, the Per-
sini 1 ings would drink of no other.
