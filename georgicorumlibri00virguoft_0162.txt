NOTES.

‘³⁶ of the proposition, in the first
‘⁶ Georgick, as he there makes use
‘⁶ of a figure, by employing sydere
“instead of tempore, so here he
‘⁶ chuses a nobler figure, by the
‘⁶ apostrophe he makes to Bacchus3
‘⁶ and in the third book, he uses the
‘⁶ same figure, for the same purpose,
⁶⁶ three times in the two first lines,
‘⁶ But this expression, manc ἴε, Bac.
⁶⁶ che, canam, having the air of a
⁶⁶ Bacchique piece, which was not
‘²⁶ by any meansthe Poet's intention,
‘⁶ he immediately gives it another
⁶⁶ turn, by declaring he will cele-
⁶⁶ brate equally with Bacchus, that
⁶⁶ is, the vine, every twig of the
‘⁶ forest. This seems to be Virgil’s
‘⁶ meaning, and this made the sub..
‘⁶ ject worthy of virgil. He under-
ί( takes to disclose all? the bounties
‘⁶ of nature in her productions of
⁸⁶ trees, and plants, and shrubs3
‘⁶ and this he does from the vine to
⁶⁶ the surze.” ΜΓ. B—

3. Tarde crescentis olivae] The
ancient Greek writers of agriculture
*speak of the olive as a very slow
-growerj whence they have given it
the epithets of ὀψίγονος, &spinam-og,
ὃψιςλαφὺς, ὃψιαιὲἦς. Pliny quotes
a passage from Hesiod, wherein he
says, that the planter of an olive
<never lived to gather the fruit of it ;
but he adds, that in his time they
planted olives one year, and gathered
⁴the fruit the next: ⁶⁶ Hesiodus quoque
⁶⁶ in primis cultum agrorum docen-
⁴5 dam arbitratus vitam, negavit
⁶³ Olea: satorum fructum ex ea per.

⁶⁶ cepisse quenquam. Tam tarda
‘⁶ tunc res erat. At nunc etiam in
⁶⁶ plantariis serunt, translatarumque
⁶⁶ altero anno decerpuntur baccae.”
But Hesiod no doubt spake of sowing
the seeds of the olive3 which will
take oss' Pliny’s objection⁷ who seems
to mean the transplauting of the
truncheons. Varro mentions also the
slow growth of olives3 but itis plain
that he speaks of sowing them3 and
therefore he observes that it is a
better way to propagate them by
truncheons: ⁶⁶ Palma et cupressus,
⁶⁶ et Olea in crescendo tarda ......
⁶⁶ Simili de causa Oleae semen cum
⁶⁶ sit nucleus, quod ex eo tardius
‘⁶ enascebatur colis, quam e taleis,
‘⁶ ideo potius in seminariis taleas,
⁶⁶ quas dixi, serimus.'' lt is not
improbable that the ancient Grecians
were unacquainted with any other
method of propagating olives, thau
by sowing them: and, as Mr. Miller
informs me, they practice that method
in Greece, to this day. This might
occasion those epsthets, mentioned.
at the beginning of this note. Hence

also Virgil might make use of the ,v

epithet slew growing5 tho’ in his
time they had a quicker way of pro.
pagating olives. ’

4. Pater Ο Lenaee] Bacchus is
peculiarly called Pater ,· thus Heraea,

‘⁶ Romulus et Liber Pater, et cum
‘⁶ Castore Polluxss'

Virgil very judiciously makes use of

the name Lenaeas ror Bacchus in this, η

placo,
