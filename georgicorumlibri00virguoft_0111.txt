But there he is speaking of single
mountains. Dz’ejecit seems more pro-
per in this place, to express the scat-
tering asunder of these mountains.
And we find in Strabo, that Ossa,
was really thought to have been torn
from Olympus· ’Υπό δὲ σεισμων ῥήγ-
ματος ’γενομένου (τὰ νῦν καλούμε να. Τέμ-
πη) καὶ την '‘Oa-eom α’ποσχι ἱζοντος cim
του Ολυμπου. This mlght give the
Poets room to feign that this vio-
leuce was committed at the time of
the war between the gods and the
giants.

284. Septima post decimam] Ser-
vius mentions three different inter-
pretations of these words: 1. The
seventeenth is lucky: 2. the seventh is
lucky‚ but not so lucky as the tenth:
3. the fourteenth is lucky, that is the
seventh doublml, which comes after
the tenth. This last is so forced an
interpretation, that Ι cannot be per-
suaded that Virgil could mean any
thing so obscure. lt must however
be confessed that Hesiod has set down
the fourteenth day as lucky sor taming
cattle:

 

, Κούρῃ δι’ τε τετροῖς

Miser, τῆἓέ τε μ’ἦῖοι, καὶ imin-0823 ’ἔλι-
κας βους,

Ka> κύνα καρχαρόδοντα, καὶ δυξηαις τα-
λαέργους

Πρη viter, ἐπὶ χεῖρα τιθείς.

The last words agree with prensos
domitare, The second Interpretation

is generally received3 and indeed
Hesiod sa) s the seventh and the tenth
days are both lucky:

Πρῶτον ἕνη, τετράς τε, καὶ iwan, ἱερέα
ἦμαρ. .

and
Ἐσθλῆ δ’ οἰνόξογᾶνος δεκέτη.

But he no where says that the se-
venth is inferior to the tenth3 nor
does he mention either osthem as for-
tunate for any part of husbandry. I
prefer the first interpretation, be-
cause it seems the most plain. Hesiod
allows it also to be one of the lucky
days:

Μέσσῃ δ’ ἒὲἓομεὶτζη Δημήτερος ἱρὸν α’κ·
