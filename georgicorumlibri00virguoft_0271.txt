smell very like rocket,especially about
Naples, and the plant is very hoary
in it’s native soil. Columella speaks
only of the use of it, as an excellent
fodder, causing abundance of milk,
and being useful also to hens and bees.
Pliny tells us, that Amphilochus wrote
a whole book about the medica, and
the cytisus.- ‘⁶ Unum de ea, et cytiso
‘⁶ volumen Amphilochus'fecit consu-
“ sim.” He says it is a shrub, and
greatly commended by Aristomachus,
the Athenian, as a good sodder:
‘⁶ Frutex est et cytisus, ab Aristo-
‘⁶ macho Atheniensi miris laudibus
“ praedicatus pabulo ovium, aridus
‘⁶ rero etiarn suum.” Thon he en..
larges upon the uses of it in increas-
ing milk, and says it is hoary, and
has the appearance os a shrubby
trefoil, with narrower leaves: ‘⁶ Ca-
‘⁶ nus aspectu, breviterque siquis ex-
‘⁶ primere similitudinem velit, an-
‘⁶ gustioris trifolii frutex.” The Cy-
,risus „Marantleoe is the (2:stch inca-
nus, siliqmsfalcalis of C. llauhin, and
the ssserlicrzgo trffolict, st·z{{<’5cens, in-
pana of Tournesort.

May translates cyliri, loto shrubs,
¹and Dryclen, vileslzrubs are shornfor
brozcze': but the ‹ysit'sns was so sar
from being accounted avile shrab, that
it was in the highest estecrn amongst
the ancients. ΜΓ. Β paraphrases
these two words, tondemur cytisi:

 

⁶⁶ The Cytisus‚ with constant verdure
⁶⁶ crown'd ,

⁶⁶ Ost soels the hoel<² and shoots at
⁶⁶ ex'ry wound.'’

T oedas sylva alta ministrat] Tor.
ches were made of any combustible
wood. Pliny mentions a sort ofpine
or firr, under thename of toeda, which
was chiefly made use of at sacrifices :
⁶⁶ Sextum genus est taeda proprie
⁶⁶ dicta: abundantior succo quarn
‘⁶ reliqua, parciorliquidiorque quam
⁶⁶ picea, flammiS ac lumini sacrorum
‘⁶ etiamgrata.”

43⁶2. pascunturque ignes nocturna]
In one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts itis
Pascuntur nocturni ignes,

433. Et dubitant homines serere
atque impendere curcum] Fulvius Ur-
sinus says this whole verse is wanting
in the old Colotian manuscript.

Itis curas in some editions.

434. Quid mqjora sequar] Here
he speaks of the great use of several
sorts of trees; and concludes with
giving them the preference to the
vine.

Humilesqne genistae] Mr. 13—-
translates genistte, fut ze, and says
ho bas taken the liberty to paraphrase
a little upon genz'stw, sepequce salis
et pabula melli sufficiunt, because he
has seen so much of the use of that
plant in both these respects:

⁶⁶ The willow, and the farte, an
‘⁶ humble plant

‘⁶ To husbandmen affort] no trivial aid3

‘⁶ That to the sheep gives food, to
⁶⁶ shephertls shade:

⁶⁶ This covers with strong lines the
“ wealthy liclds,

ὅ( And carly sother to the hee-sold
⁶⁶ yiclds.”
