144. Primi] The King’s, the
Cambridge, and one of the Arun-
delian manuscripts have primum: but
primi seems more poetic-dl, 'l'hus

“·-— — ·— Tuque O cui prima sre-
“ mentem
‘⁶ Fudit equum tellus?

And

s “ Prima Ceres ferro mortales vertere
'“ terram
‘⁶ Instituit.”

scindebant] It is findebant in the
Cambridge manuscript: but this must
be a mistake ; for findebantfissile lig-
num is by no means worthy of Vir·
gil.

145. Vicit] In most of 1110 ma-
nuscripts and printed editions it is
vincit. Pierius says it is vicit in the
Roman manuscript; and adds, that
it is vincit in the Medicean copy;
but that there is a. mark under 1110 n,
which shows it is to beexpunged. It is

vicit in one of the Arundelian manu-.

scripts : all the rest which Ihave col-
lated, have vincit. Heinsius, who
made use of one os the best copies,
reads vicit. .

148.Arbuta.] virgil uses arbu-
tum sor the fruit in this place. ln

the second Georgick 110 11505 arbutus
sor the tree; and in the third, he
makes arbatum to signify the tree.
The Greek writers call 1110 1100 κόμα-
ρις and the fruit μημκίκυλον. Pliny
calls 1110 fruit unedo. 'I'he commen-
tators observo that Horace uses arbu-
tus for the fruit.

‘⁴ Impune tutum per nemus arbutos
‘⁸' Quaerunt latentes, et thyma.'¹

But as Horace joins arbutos with thy-
ma, which cannot mean fruit, Ira-
ther believe we are to understand that
he meant the trees themselves. Lu-
cretius uses arbuta for 1110 fruit, in two
places; in one of which we find glun-
cles atque arbuta, as in this passage of
virgil. The arbute or strawberry-
tree is common enough in our gar-
dens. The fruit has very much the
appearance of our strawberry, but is
larger, and has not 1110 500115 011 1110
outside of the pulp‚like that fruit. It
grows plentifully in ltaly, where 1110
meaner sort of people frequently eat
1110 fruit, which is but a very sorry
(liet. Hence 1110 Ρο015 have supposed
the people of the first age to have
lived on acorns and arbutes in the
woods, before the discovery ofcorna
