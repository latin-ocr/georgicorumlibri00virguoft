cause they grew ⁶002 by being left;
“ Frigida lecta relinquunt 3 for they
‘⁶ become frigida by being relicta.”
It isin summer that the Bees swarm,
and as they are 10 be defended from
the extremities of heat and cold, the
hivcs may in this sense be account-
ed cool in summer and warm in
winter.

106. Τιι regibus alas eripe] In
the King⁷s manuscript it is rigidus
instead of regibus.

Dr. Trapp treats this precept of
clipping the Kiug's wings as imprae-
ticable, and makes himself mcrry ou
the occasion: ⁶⁶ But how shall one
‘⁶ catch them? '² says he, “ Or if
‘⁶ one could seize them3 would it
‘⁶ not be difficult to hold and handle
‘⁶ them, so as to cut their wc‘ngs? And
‘⁶ would not their majesties be apt
‘⁶ to dart out their royal ,sllngs ς and
‘⁶ with them their royal lives? No
‘⁶ commentator takes the least no-
(ι tice of this strange difficulty 3 nor
“ can I imagine what Virgll means.
“As if a master-Bes: were 10 be
‘⁴ singled om‘, lais! hold of, aud shorn,
“ with as much ease as the bell-wea-
‘⁶ ther of assock of sheep.'' This
precept however has been laid down
also by Columella3 “ Qui tamen et
‘⁶ ipse spoliandas esc alix, ubi saepius
⁶⁶ cum examine suo conatur eruptione
‘⁶ facta profugere: nam velut qua.
‘⁶ dum compede retinebimus erronem
⁶⁶ ducem det1actis alis, qui fugae de.

‘⁶ stitutus praesidio, finem regni non
“audet excedere, propter quod ne
‘⁶ ditionis quidem suae populo per-
‘⁶ mittit longius evagari.” Nor did
Pliny think it unworthy to be insert-
ed in his Natural History: ⁶⁶ Si quis
‘⁶ alam ei detruncet, non fugiet exa-
⁶⁶ men.'' Columella informs us how
we may take hold of the king of the
Bees with impunity: namely by per-
suming the hand with baum, which
will cause the Boos not to fly away
or resist: ‘⁶ Succo praedictarum her..
‘⁶ barum, id est melissophylli vel
‘⁶ apiastri mauu illita, ne ad tactum
⁶⁶ diffugiant, leviter inferes digitos,
‘⁶ et diductas apes scrutaberis, donec
“auctorem puguae, quem elidere
‘⁶ debes, reperias.’' Dryden's trans-
lation of the passage under consid-er-
atiou is very singulam

108. Vellere sigum] In one of
Dr. Mead's manuscripts it is tollere ε
but vellere signa was used hythe Ro-
manS, to express the moving of their ,
camp. For when they pitched their
camp they struck their ensigus into¹ the

ground before the gcueral's tent; and
