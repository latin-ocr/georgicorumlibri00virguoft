GEORG. LIB. 11.-

Indulge ordinibus: nec secius omnis in unguem
Arboribus positis secto via limite quadret.

spate the rows: but at the
same time let your trees be
planted exactly, so that every
space may square with that
which crosses it.

NOTES.

For that of a mare, in the third
Georgick:

“ Depulsus ab ubere matris ;”

 

And in the eleveuth AEneid :

“ Hic natam in dumis interque hor..
“ rendalustra,

‘⁶ Armentalis equoe mammis et lacte
“ ferino

“ Nutribat, teneris immulgens ubera
“ labris:’'

And of a doe, in the seventh
AEneid:

‘⁶ --—- Matris ab ubere raptum.”

In the second Georgick, it is used
for the fruitfulness of a field z

(6

 

Fertilis ubere campus.‘’
And in the first and third AEneid ς

“ Terra antiqua, potens armis, atque
ubere glebae .·”

And in the seventh AEneid:

(ί

 

Non vobis rege Latino, ,
‘² Divitis uber agri, Trojaeve opu.
“ lentia deerit.‘’

There are only two passageS‚ where
uber can be wrested to Ruaeus‘s sense.
The first is in this Georgick:

“ Si deerunt, rarum, pecorique et
“ vitibus almis
“ Aptius uber erit :”

Where it may as well be rendered
fruitfulness: “ The soil is loose and
“ it’s fruitficlness will be more fit
‘⁶ for cattle and vines.’' 'l he other
is in the third AEneid3

‘4 Quae vos a stirpe parentum
“ grim? tulit tellus, eadem vos ubere
ae o

“ Accipiet reduces :'’

Where it may also have the same
signification ε “ that land which pro-
‘⁶ duced your ancestors will receive
“ you also with a joyful fruiefful.
“ mess .·” and therefore the passage
now under consideration may be ren-
dered literally ‘⁶ Bacchus is not more
‘⁶ backward in fruitftclness in aclose
“ planted vineyard.”

277. Βαίας] In the Bodleian ma-
nuscript it is segnius, and in one of
the Arundelian copies it is serias.

Omnis in anguem arboribus po-
sitis secto via limite quadret] This
passage has occasioned some difficulty.
Several of the Commentators think
he is speaking of the Quincunx, of
which number are Grimoaldus and
Ruaeus. La Cerda thinks, with bet⁰
ter reason, that he means planting
the vines in a square, that is, in the
following order.
