'¹ Poet speaks also of that sign's begin-
ning the labours of the ploughman ;
as this seems to have some relation to
what Virgil has said, 1 shall set down
the whole passage:

‘⁸ Taurus simplicibus donavit rura
“ colonis:

‘⁸ pacatisque labor reniet, patientia
¹‘ laudis,

“ Sed terrae tribuct partus: summit-
“ tit aratris

“ Colla, jugumque suis poscit cer-
“ vicibus ipse.

“ Ille suis Phoebi portat cum corni·
“ bus orbem,

“ Militiam indicit terris, et segnia
.“ rura

“ ln veteres revocat cultus dux ipse
‘⁶ laboris,

‘⁶ Nee jacet in sulcis solvitque in
“ pulvere pectus.

‘⁴ Seranos Curiosque tulit, facilesque

“ per arva

Tradidit, eque suo dictator venit

“ Laudis amor, tacitae mentes, et
“ corpora tarda

“ Mole valent, habitatque puer sub
“⁶ fronte cupido.”

218. Averso cedens canis occidit
astra] Servius says some read ascr-
so, others adverso. Pierius sajs it is
adverso in the Roman and Lonibard
manuscripts: but averso in others,
in the Mediccan, he says, it is averso
incedens. The Ix'iiig's, both Dr.
Mead's‚ and one of the Arundelian

manuscripts have adverso. The other
Arunddinn, and ilie Cambridge ma-
nuscript have aser-50. 'she Bodleian
has serso. La (orda and several of
the old editors read adverso. Hein-
sius, Ruaeus, and many others prefer
aver-50. The commentators are greatly
divided about the meaning of this
passage. Servius interprets it two
different ways: if we admit adverso,
it is to be rendered ΗΜ» dog with tlte
adverse constellation, because with the
dog arises Sirius, who is adverse, ot
injurious to mankind; if we admit
averso, cum must be understood, and
the sense will bc, when the dog giving
place sets wirla the backwarcl sign,
that is, tho ship, which rises back-
wards. Grimoaldus seems to under-
stand it to mean that the dog is ob-
scured by the sun when he enters
Taurus: “ Cum canis in scorpione
‘⁶ constitutus propter tauri solem te-
“ nentis vicinitatem occulitur et ob-
‘· scutatur.” According to this in-
terpretation, the sun must be the ad-
versum astrum. La Cerda seems to
adhere to the first interpretation of
Servius: ‘⁴ Cum canis heliace occi-
“ dit‚qui habe-t asti um adversum con-
“ trariumque mortalibus.’' Ruaeus,
according to Servius’s second intel*
promnion, mins the ship ιο be the
aversum astrum .· but instead of un-
derstanding cum, with Servius, he
takes averso astro to be the dative
caso, governed of cedens. Thus the
sense will be tlte dog sets, giving place
to tlte back-ward sign, or skip. Ι ra-
ther believe, that virgil meant the
