Ι cannot help observing in this
place, that Addison‚ in his transla-

tion, has given warmth and lustre to
the Pleiades :

⁶⁶ Twice in the year their flow' ry
‘⁶ toils begin,

⁶⁶ And twice they setch their dewy
⁶⁶ harvest in3

⁶⁶ Once when the lovely Pleiades>
⁶⁶ atrise,

⁶⁶ And ad‹lf1·esh lusere to tlze summer
⁶⁶ sil-ies,-

⁶⁶ And once when hast⁷ning from the
⁶⁶ watry sign

‘2⁶ They quit their station, and sor-
⁶⁶ bear to shine.⁷'

And yet, in his letter from Italy,
he represents them as a northern
constellation:

‘⁶ W'e envy not the warmer clime,
⁶⁶ that lies

⁶⁶ In ten degrees of more indulgent
‘⁶ skies,

⁶⁶ Nor at the coarseness of our hea-
⁴⁶ ven repine,

⁶⁶ Tho’ 0⁷er our heads the srozen
‘⁶ Plee'ads shine.”

But the Pleiades do not shine over
our hcads, bnt over those of the
Egyptians and Indians. I believe
the Pleiades being called the seven
stam, occasioned this ingenious au-
thorlo mistake them for the seven
star„- called Charles's nain, which do
1 id« ed shine over our heads, andinay
be called fioLtnbeingsontz*111lw pole.
