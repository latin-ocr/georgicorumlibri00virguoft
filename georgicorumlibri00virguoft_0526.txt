NOTES.

508. §Vr-ymonis] Strymon is a ri-

ver of Macedon, on the borders of

Thrace.

509. Flevz'rse.] Pierius found
flesse sibi in the Roman manuscript.

Ararim] Pierius says it is astris in
the Roman and in some other manu-
scripts.

511. Qualis populea, δια] This
simile is no less justly than generally
almired, as one of the most heauti-
ful that ev‘er came from the mouth of
a Poet. None that ever attempted
to translate it, seem to come up to
the original. May's is not worth re-
peating. Dryden's is not contempti-
ble:

“So close in poplar shades, her

“ children gone,
‘⁶ The mother nightingale laments

ί( 0

“ &Valiggg hest some prying churl had
‘⁶ found, and thence

‘² By stealth convey’d th' unfeathcr’d

‘⁵ innocence.

“ Eut she supplies the night with
Ε( mournfulstrains,

“ And melancholly musick fills the

“ plains.’'
Dr. Trapp's translation is thus:

(ἴ As when, complaining in melodi-
“ ous gruans,

ί( ‘S‘welet Philomel‚ beneath a popliir
s iade,

‘: Mournsherlostyoung7whichsome
‘⁶ rough village hind

‘⁶ Observing‚ from their nest, un·-
“ fledg'd, has stole}

“ She weeps all night: and perch'd
“ upon a bough,

“ &Vith plaintive notes repeated fills
“ the grove.”

Lee also has attempted it, in the last
actos his tragedy of Theodosius:

“ As in some popiar shade the nigh-
“ tingale

‘⁴ With piercing moans does her lost
‘⁴ 'young bewail‚

“ Which the rough hind, observing‘
‘⁶ as they lay

“ WVarm in their downy nest, had
“ stol’n away3

“ But she in mournt'ul sounds does
‘⁶ still complain⁷

‘⁴ Sings all the night, tho' all her
‘⁶ songs are vain,

‘⁶ And still rencws her miserable·
‘⁶ strain.”

To these I shall add another nansia.-

tion, which was made by a lady, and
has not yet I believe appeared in
