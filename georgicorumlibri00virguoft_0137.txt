NOTES.

9, The fatal owle high mounted at
“ sun-set,

‘⁶ Does not the balefull evening song
“ repeat.''

Dryden has translated this passage
most wretchedly ε

“And Owls that mark the setting
⁶⁶ sun, declaret, ·

‘⁶ A star-light Eveniug, and a morn-
⁶‘ ing fair.’'

Dr. Trapp translates nequicquam, in
vam :

‘⁶ — — And now the bird
“ OtL‘nngllIilt, observant os the Setting
7

“ Sings herlatc song from some high
⁶‘ tow’r in vain.”

‘⁶ Nequicqzcam (says this learned
‘⁶ gentleman) sor non is intolerable:
“and Servius gives us no authority
‘⁶ for it but Persius’53 which consi-
“ dering the obscurity of that wri-
‘⁶ ter, is nothing at all. Besides3
‘⁶ ’tis well known that the musick
⁶⁶ of the owl (such as it is) is a
‘⁶ prognostick of dry weather. I
‘⁴ therefore take it thus; that dark
“ bird delighting in rain and clouds
‘⁶ makes this noise, by way of eom.
‘⁶ plaint. not osjoy (for ’tis a dismal
“ditty indeed) at the approach of
‘⁶ fair weather: but does it neqnic.
‘⁶ quam, in vain: for that weather
⁶‘ will come, for all her lzootz'ngst'

This interpretation seems to be very

much forced, and not to be supported
by any good authority. Mr. B -— ’s
interpretation is not very different.
‘⁶ Virgil enibellishes this mean sub-
⁶⁶ ject 111 a very extraordinary man-
⁶⁶ ner. When he is to say that the
‘⁶ leooting of oza-ts at night is a sign of
‘² fair weather‚ he takes occasion to
‘⁶ make a delicate reflection upon
“superstitious people. Owls were
‘⁶ supposed by such persons always to
“ forebode some calamit-y by their
“ noise3 but now, says he, they sing
‘⁶ nequicquam, in vain3 sor no body
‘⁶ is so weak as 10 expect bad weather
‘⁶ from their musick.”

404. Aera] In one of Dr. Mead's
manuscripts it is retbere: it is the
same also in the Roman manuscript,
according to Pierius.

405. Et pro purpureo plenas dat
Scylla capillo] The story of Nisus
andScyllais related in the eighth book
of Ovid’s Metamorphoses. Nisus
was king of Alcatho'e or Megara.
He had on his head a purple hair, in
which the security of the kingdom
lay. Scylla, his daughter, falling des-
perately 111 love with Minos, who
besieged the city, stole the purple
hair, and fied uith it to him. But
thatjust Prince abhorring the crime,
rejected her with indignation, and
sailed to Crete, leaving her behind.
Scylla, in despair, plunged 11110 the
sea after him, and took fast hold of
the ship. Her father, who had just
been changed into the Ilale·a·e'tos‚
which is thought to be the Osprey3
a rapacious bird of the eagle kind,
