But in the first place, above all
things, mav the sweet Muses,
whose priest l am, being smit-
ten with great love of poesy,
receive me, and shew me the
paths of heaven, and the stars,
the various eclipses of the sun,
and labours of the moon: what
causes the earth to tremble;
by what force the deep scas
swell‚ and break their banks,
and then again fall back3 why
1119 winter suns make such
haste to dip themselves in the
ocean ; or what delay reim-ds
the slow niglits. But if the
chill blood about my heart
hinders nie from attaining to
these parts of natur-eg may
neuls and strenuis gliding in
vallies deligm nie3 may 1 love
rivers and woods inglorious ς
oh! where there are plain«,

NOTES.

Astraea or Justice was seigned by
the Poets to have descended from
heaven in the golden age. She con-
tinued upon earth till the wickedness
of the brazen age gave her such
offence, that she left mankind and
ssew up to heaven. Aratus says, she
retired first from citios, into the
country, so that this was the last
place she left. The Greek Poet speaks
largely on this subject.

4¹75. Me vero primum, &c.]
Poet here declares his natural Incli-
natiou to be towards Philosophy and
Poetry. He declares himself to be
1119 priest os the Muses; and prays
them to instruct him iu Astronomy:
to {each him the causes of eclipses,
earthquakes, the ssux and ressux of
the sea, and of the unequal length of
days and nightS. The next wish is,
that, if he cannot obtain this, he may
enjoy a quiet retirement ἰ11 the
country.

476. Quarum sacra serm] It is
usual with the Poets to call themselves
‘priests of the Muses: Thus Horace :

The

⁴⁴ Carmina non prius

‘⁶ Audita Musarum S acerdos
‘⁸' Virginibus puerisque canto :”

 

And Ovid :

⁴⁶ Ille ego Musarum purus, Phoebique
‘4 S cacerclvse’

479. Tzemescana] It is tumescunt
in the Lombard manuscript, accord- b
ing to Pierius: thus Ι find residuntin
the next verse.. instead of residant, in
some of the old editions.

485. Rigzcz‘] Pierius says it is ri.
gidz· in the Roman manuscript.

486. Inglorius] Philosophy, inr
Virgil's time, was in great reputa-
tion amougst the Romans. Our'
Poet seems to have had Lucretius in
his eye, when he wrote this passage.
He entreats the Muses to teach him
the lwights of Philosophy, which that

Poet had described with so much ele. ’ ’
But if he cannot reach so . ,

{3:2ss begs, in the next place, that

he may have a secure, quiet retire-
