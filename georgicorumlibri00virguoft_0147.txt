for bulls and coa-s.-

‘⁶ Principio genus acre leonum, soe-
‘⁶ vaque soecla

‘⁶ Tutata ’st virtus, vulpes dolus, et
‘⁶ fuga cervos3

‘⁶ At levisomna canum fido cum pec..

singular. obscaenus amongst the Au-
gurs was applied to any thing that
was reputed a bad omen. Appian
mentions dogs howling like wolres,
after the death οἵ Caesar. Ovid
speaks of dogs howling by night in
the Forum, and about houses, and
the temples of the gods:

‘4 Inque foro, circumque domos, et
‘⁶ templa Deorum
‘⁶ Nocturnos ululasse canes.’'

Importunoeque volucres] , ovid
mentions the owls as giving omens.

“Tristia mille locis Stygius dedit
‘⁴ omina bubo.”

Some omens of birds are mentioned

death of Caesar.

mania coelo audiit] Ovid speaks of

'the clashing of arms, and the noise

of trumpets and horus z
