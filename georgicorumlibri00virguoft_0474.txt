Vv'o here lcarn, that the fioyver in
question was shaped like a lily, was
of a red colour, and was marked
with tho letters A I. Ι have more
than once mentioned the difficulty of
preciscly determining the colours
mentioned by the Ancients. ovid
calls the ssower of the Hyacinth Tyrio
nitentior ostro, and purpureus.
Virgil calls it in this place ferru-
gineus, and in the third Eclogue he
calls it suave rubens; and in the
elcventh AEncid he speaks ofits great
brightness:

Hence we can only gather, that the
colour of this fiower is a deep shining
red. I talgc the epithetferrugineos
in this place only to express the
‹icepness of the colour. Thus infithi
