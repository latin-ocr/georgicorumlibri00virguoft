NOTES.

sius has embraced this reading3 but Ι ‘⁶ Ac velut annoso validam cum ro..

take it to be corrupt⁴ Ausim vilem
committere ac arbos defigitur is such
a connection, ἃς, Ι believe, Virgil
would not hare made use of. Oi)-
serve how wretchedly it appears iu
English: ⁶⁶ I would venture my vine
‘⁶ in a slight furrow, (md a taller tree
‘⁶ is planted deep in the groundst
The reading would be tolerable, if
it was at instead of ac: but no autho.
rity is offered for this alteration. But
even, if this was admitted, mlier in
this place, would be a poor and use-
less epithet. I take altius to have
been altered to altior, by some taste-
less transcribet-9 who taking a vine to
be a tree, thought there wanted an
epithet to make a distinction between
vitis and arbos. But vines were not
accounted trees; but skrzcbs, or some.
thing of a middle nature between
trees and shrubs. Thus Columella:
⁷ ⁶⁶ Nam ex surculo vel arbor procedit,
⁶⁶ ut olea: vel frutex, ut palma cam.
⁶⁶ pestris: vel tertium quiddam, quod
‘⁶ nec arborem, nec fruticem proprie
⁶⁶ dixerim, ut est vitis.³'

221. AEsculas.] See the note on
ver.' 15.

Quantum vertice ad αιινας, &c.]
This very expression is used of the
Quercus, in the fourth ⁴Eueid3

‘⁶ bore quercum

⁶⁶ Alpini Boreae, nuuc hinc, nunc
⁶⁶ flatibus illinc

‘⁶ Eruere inter se certant3 it stridor,
⁶⁶ et altae

‘⁶ frondes:

⁶⁶ Ipsa haeret seopulis: et quantum
⁶⁶ vertice ad (curas

⁶⁶ AEtherms, tantam radice in Tar.
⁶⁶ tara tendit.⁷’ ”

993. Non flabra] In one of the
Arundelian manuscripts it is nec fla-
bra.

⁶294. Multosque nepotes] So I read
with Heinsius and Masvicius. The
same reading is in the Roman manu-
script according to Pierius. Others
read multosque per annos.

297. Ipsa] Itis ipsam in one of the
Arundelian manuscripts.

298. Neve tihi ad solem, &c.] In
this passage are several short precepts
relating to vineyards, with a beautiful
account ot' the danger of intermixing
wild olives with the vines, lest a fire
should kindle among them, and de.
stroy the vineyard.

Columella, speaking of the aspect
of a vineyard‚ tells us that the an.

cients were greatly divided about liIt.
