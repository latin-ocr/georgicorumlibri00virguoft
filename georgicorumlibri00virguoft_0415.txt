GEORG. LIB. 111.

Non tamen ulla magis praesens fortuna laborum

est,

Quam si quis ferro potuit rescindere summum
Ulceris os ε alitur vitium, vivitque tegendo3
Dum medicas adhibere manus ad vulnera pastor
Abnegat, aut meliora Deos sedet omnia poscens.
Quin etiam ima dolor balantum lapsus ad ossa
Cum furit, atque artus depascitur arida sebris3
Profuit incensos aestus avertere, et inter
Ima ferire pedis salientem sanguine venam ε
Bisaltae quo more solent, acerque Gelonus,

452. Non tamen ulla, &c.] It has
not without reason been said by the
writers of Virgil's life, that our Poet
had studied Physick. The respect
with which he mentions the Physician
Iapis, aud the many medicines occa.
sionally mentioned in his works,
greatly favour this tradition. He has
just mentioned an ointment, com-
pounded with greater skill, and de-
scribed with greater propriety of ex-
pression, than any that we meet with
in the other writers of Agriculture.
He now adds with much judgment
that no application is of so much
service, as to lay open the ulcer, and

give a free discharge to the corroding ’

maaiheg: Rescindere] It properly sig-

nifies to open; in which sense it is
used also in the twelfth AEneid :

“ Ense secent lato vulnus, telique
ξ( latebram

‘⁶ Rescimlcmt penitus.”

In the same manner it seems to have
beeu used by Lucretius: ⁴

‘⁴ proptereaque solere vias rescindere
‘⁴ nostris

(ζ Sensibus.⁷’

454. Alltur vitiam, vivitque te-
gendo] Thus also Lucretius:

‘⁶ Ulcus enirn vivescit, et inveterascit
‘⁶ alend0.''

Roman manuscript, according to

nice edition insol. 1475. La Cerda
reads omina.
