Mr. Poma.

‘To the same purpose Theocritus is
quoted ln hlS Διὸσκουξο ο.ι

’Υμνέ εομες Antion ’τε και αιγιόχω Διος

Τυνδαρῖἕα, ταχύπωλε, δορυσσόε, χαλ-

ὲ κεοθῶραξ.

 

{Here Theocritus does not seem how-
ever to make any distinction between
the two brothers as fighting, the one
on horseback, vthe other on soot.
The difference he seems to make is
taken from their weapons‚ Pollux
using the cestus, and Castor the spear.
Indeed he calls Castor ταχύπωλε,
but he immediately introduces him
fighting on soot, as well as his bro.-
ther. Creech in his translation of
the tw'o first verses, replesmts them
both as horsemen, and using the

cestus ε

‘⁶ ιΙῖαἰι· L eda’ s sons, and mighty Jore's
¹“ ‘Caistzii-‘gand Pollux, glories of the

. ‘⁴ bravo a force,
Ε None gulde so well the fury of

Horace also is quoted in opposition
to virgil, for he plainly says, that
Castor delighted in horses, but Pol..
lux in the cestus: -

(ί Castor gaudet equis: ovo prognae
‘⁶ tus eodem
‘⁴ Pugnis.”

But here Horace seems to have for
gotten the story, f‚or according to
the old sablo, Castor and Pollux did
not come out of the. same (gg, but
Castor and Clytemnestra out of one,
and Pollux and Helen out of the
others Seneca also, in his Hippolytus
expressly declares Cyllarus to be the
horse of Castor:

‘⁶ Si dorso libeat cornipedis vehi,

‘⁶ Fraenis Castorea nobilior manu

‘⁶ ‘Spartanum poteris flectere Cylla-
rum:”

As does Valerius Flaccus, in his first
book of Argonauticks:

⁶⁵ — Castor dum quaereret Hel-q

(ί
“ Palsesss's Amyclaea pinguescere Cyl-q
‘⁶ laron herba:”

 

And Claudian, in his fourth Consul,
Ship of Honorius:

ί( Si dominus legeretur equis, tua
‘⁶ posceret ultro

‘⁶ Verbera Nereidum stabulis nutri.-
‘·‘ tus Arion.

‘⁶ Serviretque tuis contempto Castore*
