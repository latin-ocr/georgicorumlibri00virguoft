But he bestows the epithet os savus
on Typhoeus: and indeed Hesiod
gives a terrible description of this
uiant.

b 281. Terszmt conati imponere Pe-
lio Ossam] The sable of the war of
the giants against the gods is well
known. Homer mentions this heap..
ing up of mountains on mountains,
but he differs from Virgil in placing
them:

Ὀσσαν ἐπ’ Ὀυλύμπῳ μέμασαν θέμεν,
αὐτοίξ ἔπ’ Ὀσσῇ

Πήλιον ἒινοσίφυλλον, ἵν’ §parag σέμςατός
εἷή·

⁶⁶ ‘I‘Ieav'd onOlympus tott'ring Ossa
εί Otitgzga' Pelion nods with all his

‘⁶ wood.'’
Mr. Popn.

Olympus seems the fittest sor the
foundation, being the biggest of the
three mountains. Longinus brings
these verses of Homer, as an instance
of the Sublime7 and observes, that
the Poet, not content with barely
mentioning this attempt of the giants
immediately adds that they had al-
most effected what they designed:
Καὶ νύ κεν ἐξετέλεσσαν. But, With all
due submission to that excellent Cri-
tiek, I think the sublimity of this
passage is rather diminished than aug-
mentcd by the following line:

r τ t n θ’) Ι
Καὶ νυ κεν εξεπλεσσᾳν ει ἠε-ης perfer
ἵκοντο.

‘⁶ They would have brought to pass
‘⁵ what they dcsigned, if they had
“ arrived to their full strength.”
Surcly what idea soever this gives of
the strength of the giants, it dimi.
nishes the power of Jupiter and the
rest of the gode, who with so much
difficulty subdued a few boys, who
had not yet arrived to their fun
strength. Virgil has enlarged the
idea of Homer, by saying that the
giants made this attempt three times
before they could be subdued. The
labour of the giants in heaping
mountain upon mountain is very
beautifully expressed in the numbers
of this verse:

‘⁶ Ter sunt conati imponere Pelio·
“ Ossam.⁷’

It is impossible to read it without a
pause.

283. Di.2;1'ecit.] Pierius says it is'
dejecit in the Roman manuscript.—
The same reading is in the Cambridge,
the Arundeliaii, and one of Dr.
Mead’s manuscripts. Virgil has used
dejicit in this Georgick:

 

 

“ Ille flagranti

‘⁶ Aut Atho, aut Rhodopen, aut alta
“ Ceraunia telo ·

‚⁴⁶ Dejicit.’{
