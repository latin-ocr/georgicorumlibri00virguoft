NOTES.

ζ 204. Putre solum] Putre signi-
> fies rotten, crumbling‚ or Ioose. The
Poet explains it here himself, and
tells us it is such a soil, as we pro-
cure by plowing. Therefore in this
place he recommends such a soil for
coru as is in it's own nature loosc,
and crumbliug: because we endea-
vour to make other soils so by art.
Agreeable to this Columella tells us,
that such a soil, as is naturally loose,
requires little labour of plowing:
“ Pastinationis expertes sunt exter-
“ narum gentium agricolae: quae ta-
“ men ipsa pene supervacua est iis
“ locis, quibus solnm putre, el per se
“ resolutum est: namque hoc imitamur
“ arando, ut ait Virgilius, quod etiam
“ pastinando. ItaqueCampatiia‚quo-
“ niam vicinum ex nobis capere po·
“ test exemplum, non utitur hac
“ molitione terrae, quia facilitas ejus
“ soli minorem operam desiderat.”
205. Non ullo] In the Cambridge
manuscript it is nonnullo, which is
manifestly an error of the transcriber.
206. Decedera] In one of¹ Dr.
Mead's manuscripts it is descendere.
207. Iratus] This epithet seems
to be added, to express the anger or
impatience of the ploughman, who
sees his land overgrown with wood,
which otherwise might bear good
crops of corn.

Dera-ih] It is dejecit, in the Mc-
dicean manuscript, according to Pie-
rius. ·

¹209. Antiqnczsque domos ariam,
δια] “ I understand this place,
⁴⁶ says Mr. B—-, in a manner diffe-
“ rent from Ruaeus‚ and others, who
“ interpret stirpibus imis, the. roots of
“ the trees. These arc connected to
“ domos avium, and consequentiy, ac-
“ cording to Virgil’s clear way of
“ writing, must relate to the birds;
“ besides, if they related to the
“ roots of the treffl, it would be an
“ useless tautology; for, that the roots
were grubbed up, is said before,
“ nemora evertit. And again, cum
“ stirpibus imis is the best expression
‘⁴ possible to describe where the birds
‘⁴ young ones were lodged3 for it is
‘⁶ well known, that by getting down
into the bottonis of decayed trccS,
“ several sorts ot' birds preserve their
“ brood. 1 translate allum, the top
‘⁶ of the trev, aud not the air, bc-
“ cause, iu lact, when hollow old
“ trees are fellea, in which birds have
“ young onos, they always keep ho-
“ vei-ing about the top, and making
“ a lamentablc noise for several days
“ together.'' According to this in·
te1·pretation‚he translates the passage
thus:
