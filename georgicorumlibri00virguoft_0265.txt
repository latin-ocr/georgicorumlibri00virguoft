the labour 'of cultivating vines is so
great, that the master cannot extend
his care over a very large spot of
ground. Columella relatesa story
from Graecinus, in confirmation of
this. A man had two daughters,
and a large vineyard, of which he
gave a third part with the eldest
daughter in marriage: and yet he
gathered as much fruit as he did be-
fore. Afterwards he married the
younger daughter, with another
third sor her portion; and still found
that his remaining third part produced
as much as the whole had done:
which could arise from no other
cause, than that he was able to cul-
tivate a third part better than the
whole vineyard before it was divided.

The same author mentions this pre.

from a saying of one os the seren

wise men, and that it was a proverb
of the Carthaginians, that α field

which they derived more profit, than.
