Catrou, that this verse was inserted,
in the year 734, we can have no
doubt, but that virgil alluded to the
debate already mentioned

28. Umlcmtem bello magnumque

rides we1e lndians living near the fluentem Nzlzcm] This relates tothe

Ganges. These people were not sub-
dued at the time, when Virgil wrote
his GeorgickS. Catroujustly observes
that Virgil must have added this and
the preceding xerse, long aster he had
first published the Georgicks. This
whole alltgory of the temple seems
to have been added by the Poetin
the year of Rome 734, when history
informs us, that Augustus subdued
the Indians, and the Parthians, and
recovered the engles which had been
lost by Crassus. This was the year
before the death of Virgil: whence
we may obser-ve, that ¹*he continued
to correct and improve this noble
Poem, till the time of his death.

11110115 that it 11 115 debated 111 the Se-
nate, 1111011111 Augustus or Romulus
should be the name of him, who be-
fore was called Octavianus. But he
observes that this happened in the
year of Rome 727, three years aste r
the publication of the Georgicks.
Hence he concludes that it nas a
private flattery of Vir-gil, and had

no relation to what was debated 111,

xictory obtained over the Egyptians
and their allies, commanded by An-
thony and Cleopatra, m the year of
Rome 7⁶24.

29. Navali surgentes aere colam-
nam] Servius tells 115, that Augustus,
having conquered all Egypt, took
abundance of beaks of ships, and made
four columns of them, which were
afterwards placed by Domitian in the
Capitol, and were to be seen iu his
time.

30. chlszcmque Niphaten] Niphates
is the name of a mountain and river
of Armenia. The people of this
country were subdued after the de-
cree of the Senate, by which the name
Augustus was given to Octavianus:
for Horace mentions this, as a new
iictory, and at the same time gives
him the name of Augustus:
