443. Pellacz'a.] The common
reading is fallacia. I have restored
pellacia, on the authority of Hein-
sius. Pierius also found pellaciam
some manuscripts. In the second

AEneid we find

(ί - - Invidia postquam pellacis
‘⁶ Ulyssei.’'

447. Scis Protea, scis ipsa] Thus
also Menelaus.

Graecism, for nec ‚licet cuiquam 3
thus in the second Eclogne, vec sic

quod versa dicere non est.

449. Venimus, hinc lapsis] This
readingwas found byPierius in theRo- ·
man and other ancient manuscripts.
Itis the same in one of the Arundelian,
and in both Dr. Mead’s manuscripts.
It is admitted also by Heinsius, Mas'-
vicius, and several of the old editors.

Poet now proceeds to the answer of
Proteus, wherein he tells Aristaeus,
the cause of his disaster was the injury

offered by him to Eurydice, the wige}
