Cambridge, the Bodleian, and both
the Arundelian manuscript& Hein-
sius also and Mam-icius leave out
cst.

This verse is also in the eighth
Eclogue.

327. Ubi quarta sitim coelicollege-
rit Imm] The Poet is thought 10
mean such hours, as divide the ar-
tificial day into twelre equal parts.
Thus, at the equinox, the 'fourth
hour will be at ten in the morning:
but at the solstice, it will be at half
an hour after nine in Italy, where
the day is then fifteen hours long, ac.
cording to Pliny: ⁶⁶ Sic fit, ut ra..
‘⁶ rio lucis incremento in Meroe
‘⁶ longissimus dies xii horas aequi.
⁶⁶ noctiales, et octo partes unius horae
⁶⁶ colligat, Alexandriae vero xiv horas.
⁶⁶ In Italia quindecim. In Britan.
⁶⁶ nia xvii.” In England, according
to 11115 interpretation, the fourth hour
will be about nine.

Grimoaldus seems to unders÷and the
Poet to mean by the words now un-
der consideration, when the fourth
honr has gothered the drought of the
air: ⁶⁶ cum hora post exortum solem
⁶⁶ quarta siccitatem a'eris contraxerit,
⁶⁶ roremque calore absumpserit.” In
this sense May translates it:

ἕ ⁶ - -— — That dew away
⁶⁶ 3³3?an the fourth houres thirsty

But I rather believe, with La Cerda,
that Virgil’s meaning is, when the
fourth bour of the day has made the

cattle il‘zz‘rsly. ovid uses silim colli..

gere not for gathcring up the dew,-
but for growing thirstgy :

⁶⁶ Jamque Chimaeriferae, cum sol
⁶⁶ gravis ureret arva,

⁶⁶ Finibus in Lyciae longo dea fessa
‘⁶ labore,

‘⁶ ⁶{idei-eo siccata sitim collegit ab ae-
εἴωθ’

Dr. Trapp’s translation is according
to this sense:

⁶⁶ -- —- -—- - But when advancIng
(ζ day,

⁶⁶ At the fourth honr, gives thirsi to
‘⁶ men and beasts.’'

Dryden comprehende, both interpre-
tations:

⁶⁶ But when the day’s fourth hour has
⁶⁶ drawn the dews,

⁶⁶ And the sun’s sultry heat their
⁶⁶ thirst teneres?
