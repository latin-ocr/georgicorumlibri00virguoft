the scarlet flowers, which is common
in our corn fields, but those serts
which we cultivate in our gardens.
That they were cultivated by the
ancient Romans, is plain from the di-
rections, which all their writers give.
about sowing them. That it was
not our corn poppy‚ but that of the
gardens, appears from the figure of it's
head in the hand of many statues of
Ceres. The head of the gardeu pop-
py is round, but that of the red pop-
py is long and slender, us Pliny has
justly observed, lib. 20. cup. 18.
“ Sativum omne magis rotundat ca-
“ pita; at sylvestri longum ac pusil—
“ lum.'’ This author therefore seems
ιο contradict himself, when he recl<-
ons this red sort, lib. 19. cap. 9.
amongst the cultivated poppies. He
there mentions three sorts3 the white
one, of which the autients used to
eat the seeds: the black one, from
which opium is obtained: and the
rhenus, or erraticum, which frequently
grows amongst barley‚ resembling
rocket, acubit in heighffi, with a red
flower which soon falls off, whence it
is called in Greek rhoeas. This is a
plain description os our red poppy or
corn-rose. Ι sball set down the au-
thor's own words: ‘⁶ Papaveris satiri
“tria genera: candidum, cujus se-
“ men tostum in secunda mensa, cum
“ melle apud antiquos dabatur. Hoc
ξ* et panis rustici crustae inspergitur
“affuso ovo inhaerens, ubi inferio-
⁴‘ rem crustam apium githque cere-
“ ali sapore condiunt. Alterum ge-
“nus est papaveris nigrum, cujus

‘⁶ scapo inciso lacteus succus excipi-

“ cant Graeci‚ id nostri erraticum.
“ Sponte quidem, sed in arvis, cum
‘⁵ hordeo maxime nascitur, eruc-te
‘⁶ simile, cubitali altitudine, flore
ruffo et protinus deciduo, unde ct
nomen a Graecis accepit.'' The
white poppy is cultivated in our Phy-
sic gardens; the heads being much in
use: for os them is made the syrup,
which is generally known by the
name of Diacodium. The black
poppy is not only sown in our gar-
dens, but grows wild also in several
places. I have found it in great
plenty on banks, between Cambridge
and Ely. The seeds of it are sold for
birds, under the name of maw seed.
The beautiful double poppies so fre-
quint in gardenS, are the same spe·

mentioned. On this account virgil

plowing every other year, and ob-
