a great noise with clapping
their wings. Now may you see

383. Jam varias pelagi volucres,

cient manuscripts, the words are
placed thus: Jcmz volucres pelagi
να-νίαε ,· and that in some it is atque
Asia for et qzcae Asia. He observes
also that it is varice in the Roman
manuscript. I find the same reading
in the Bodleian, and in one of the
Arundelian manuscripts ι but the
grammatical constructIOn will hardly
allow it not to be varias. The other
Arundclian manuscript has tum in-
stead of jam.

Aratus has mentioned this prog-

Virgil seems to have imitated this
verse of the second Iliad ς

Tho Asia palus or Asius campus is
the name· of a fenny country, which
receives the overflowings of the Cay-
ster. The first syllable of this ad..
jective is always long3 as in the pas.
sago now before us; and in the fourth
Georgiek : ’

⁶⁶ AtquoEphym, atquc Opis, et Asia
‘⁶ De'iopeia :'’ Χ “

and in the seventh AEneid:

‘⁶ Sonat amnis et Asia longe
“ Pulsa. palus.”

 

The first syllable of Asia, the name
of a quarter of the world, is short3
as in the second Georgick:

‘⁶ Qui nuncextreffis Asioe jam vic-
“ tor in oris.”

Cayster or Caystrus is the name of a
river of Asia, which rises in Phrygia
major, passes through Lydia and {alltlg
