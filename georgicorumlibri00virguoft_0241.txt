Cum longa cohortes explicuit legia]
A Roman legion consisted of ten
cohorts. These legions marched in
a square3 but, in time of battle, they
were drawn into a longer form, which
virgil beautifully expresses by longa
cohortes explicuit legio.

manuscripts it is at. In several of
the old editions itis et.

, both the Arundelian manuscriptS, and

in the old Nuremberg edition, it is
renitenti. Pierius found the same
reading in some old manuscripts: but
renidenti in the Roman, and some
others. This is the only simile in the
second Georgick: but never did any
Poet draw one with greater propriety.

of the clusters is nuely represented
by the splendor of the brazen arms,
and not a word is used, that does
not serve. to justify the comparison.

Dryden has translated cum longa
cohortes explicuit legio,

“ As legions in' the field their front
‘⁶ display :²’

which is the very reverse of Virgil’s
expression: for, instead of displaying
their front, they are drawn up, in
time of battle, with a narrosrer frunt,
than in their march.

‘⁶ And equal Mars, like an impartiat
‘⁶ lord,

‘⁴' Leaves al} to fortune, and the dint
‘⁶ of sword.'' ’

This is a very bad translation of
dubius mediis Mars errat in armis.
Virgil's sense is, that Mars still
hovers doubtfully between the two
armies, not having yet determined to
which side to give. the victory, not:
a man has yet stirred from his place,
to give the onset. Mr. Β 's
translation begins:

 

‘⁶ As when two mighty armies all in
‘⁵ sight,

‘4 Stretch‘d on some open plain, be-
‘⁶ gin the fight.’‘

But Virgil does not compare his vine-
yard to two armies: but only to that
of the Romans. The (lesign of the
Poet is to celebrare the exaretness of
the military discipline of his own
country in rauging their soldier53 to
which the barbarous discipline of
their enemics was by no means to he
compared. Dr. Trapp’s translation
comes much nearer the sense of his
author, and is almost literal.
