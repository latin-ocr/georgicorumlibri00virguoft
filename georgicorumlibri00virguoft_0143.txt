445] Sese diversi rumpent rachel]
Pierius says it is rumpunt in the Ro-
man manuscript 3 and rumpent in the
Medieeau, and. other ancient manu-
scripts. It is rumpent in the King’s,
the Cambridge, and both the Arun-
delian manuscripts. Heinsius, Mas.
vicius, and several other editors, have
the same reading. Servius, La Cer-
da, Ruaeus, and others read erum-

ent.
p This prognostick of the scattering
of the rays of the sun is taken also
from Aratus:

Ἀλλ’ ὃυχ’ ὅππὸτε κοῖλος ἓειὲὄμενος

περιτέλλῃ,

’0υὲ ὃπ6τ’ εἷκτῖνων, ἂι μὲν νότον, οἶι

’Ama‘ που ἦ inoffi διέρχεται, ἦ οἰνέ-
flamo-

446. Surget] So Pierius found it
in the Medicean and other ancient
manuscripts, tho', he sayS, there are
some that read surgit. One of the
Arundelian, and both Dr. Mead's
Mauuscripts have Surgit. Almost
all the printed editions have surget.

447. Tithonicroceum linquens Au-
rora cubile] This verse is repeated in
the third, and ninth AEneids. Ti-
thonus was the son of Laomedon,
king of Troy. Aurora, orthemorn-
ing is sabled to have fallen in love
with him. Homer speaks of Aurora
rising from the bed of Tithonus, in
the eleventh Iliad:
