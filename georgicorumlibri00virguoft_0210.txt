NOTES.

“ teriis collocata.'' Ruceus also in-
terprets it, “ Oppida manu extructa
‘⁴ in altis 1·upibUS.” Thus also Dry-
den translates it :

¹‘ Our forts on steepy hills :''
And Dr. Trapp:
“ On tops

“ Of cragey hills so many towns up-
“ rcar’d.’'

 

La Corda takes it to mean towns, in
which buildings are raised by hu-
man infflistry, like rocks and preci-
pices: “Oppida in quibus aedificia
“ instar praecipitii et rupium effor-
“ mata ab humana indust1·ia.'' May
interprcts it towns sortificd with
¹ rocks:

(ί

 

 

Towns, that are
“ Penced with rocks impregnable.”

ΜΓ. E-——gives it yet another sense:

“ Λᾶς] towns unnuxnbcffd, that the
“ land adom,

“ By toiling hands from rocky quar-
“ ries torn.”

157. fluminaque antiquos subterla-
bentia muros] Some take this to
mean, that the walls of these towns
arc so built as to give admittance to

rivers, which flow thro' them. Others
think the Poet speaks of the famous
aqueducts. But the general opinion
is, that he means the rivers which
flow close by the walls. Thus when

any action is performed close to the ⁷

walls of a>town, we say it is done
unslet· the walls.

158. Aa mare, quod supra, memo·
rem, quodque alluit irgfra 52] In one
of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts it is abluit.

Italy is washed on the north side
by the Adriatic sea, or Gulf of Ve-
nice, which is called mare superum,
or the upper sea,· and on the south
side, by the Tyrrhene, or Tuscan sca,
which is called mare inferum, or the
lower sca. We have a like expres·
sion in the eighth AEueid 2

‘⁴ Quin omnem Hesperiam penitus
“ sua subjuga mittant;

“ Et mare quod supra, teneant, quod-
“ que alluit infra?

159. Lori maxima] The Larius
is a great lake, at the foot of the Alps,
in the Milanese, now called Lago di
Como.

160. Benace] The Benacus is
another great lake, in the veronese,
now called Lago di Garda3 out of
which flows the Mincius, on the
banks of which our Poet was born.

161. Lucrinoque addita claustra,
δῖα] Lucrinus and Avernus are two

lakes
