taken pains to let his readers know,
that the west wind was opposite to
those who would sall from Abyd0s3
if that had been true. ⁷ But, in reali-
ty, it is the north wind, or Boreas,
which was always reckoned to blow
from Thrace, and Sestos is known
to have been on the Thracian shore.

261. Scopulis illisa reclamant
aequora] Catrou interprets this of
the waves pushing back Leander from
the coast of Sestos3 ‘⁴ Les ssots re-
‘⁶ poussoient Leandre de la cote de
‘⁶ Sestos, vers Abydos sa patrie.”
*But surely the Poet's meaning is, that
the waves dashing violently on the
rocks in a storm ought not to pre-
vent any one from venturingout to sea.

¹263. Virga] This word is not
used by the Poets in so strict a sense,
as we use the word virgin. Thus
Pasiphae is called vlrgo, in the sixth
Eclogue, in two places x

The difference between these animals
not being commonly well known, I
shall here set down the marks· by
which they are distinguished. The
tiger is as large, or larger than a lion,
and marked with long streaks. The
leopard is smaller than the tiger, and
marked with round spots, The ounce
or lynx is osa reddish colour, like
a fox, marked with blaek spots: the
hairs are gray at the bottom, red in
the middle, and whitish at the t0p3
those, which compose the black spots,
are only of two colom-s, having no
white at the top. ¹ The eyes are very
bright and fieryg and the ears are
tipped with thick shining hairs, like
black velvet. It is an animal of ex-
ceeding fierceness.

one of Dr. Mead's manuscripts, and
several of the old printed editions, it
is quidque.

Our great Ilarvey, who had par-
ticularly studied these animals, and
had perhaps better opportunities of
being acquainted with their nature,
than any man, observes, in his trea-
ti5e of the Generation of Animals,
that stags are very furious about rut-
