weave baskets of it‘s slender branehes.
The flowers are very sweet, last long,
aud are agreeable to bees. This
agrees with what Virgil says of it
afterwards in this Georgick:

 

¹ ‘⁶ Saliceshumilesque Gem‘stae,
“ Aut illae pecori frondem, aut pas-

‘⁴ toribus umbram

ἶ( Ξυίῖὶοίυῃῐς,ερρρωι1ιιε satis, et pa-
‘⁶ bula melli.'’

What Pliny says of the Gem'sta agrees
very well with theSpanish hroom. In
lib. 21. c. 9. he says. it has a yellow
flower, and is used in garlands:
‘⁶ Transeat ratio ad eas coronas,
‘⁶ quae varietate sola placent. Duo
‘⁵ earum genera, quando alite flore
‘⁶ constant, aliae folio, Florem esse
“ dixerim Genistas: namque et iis
‘⁶ decerpitur lutezcs.’' In lib. 2 l. c. 9.
he says the seed grows in pods, like
kidney-beans ε “ Senien . . . . . . . . in
ι( folliculis, Phaseolorum modo, nas-
‘⁶ cens:” and that the plant is used
for withs to bind3 and that the ssow-
ers are agreeable to bees: ‘⁶ Genista
“ quoque vinculi usum praestat.
“ Flores apibus gratissimi.’' ln leth.
16. c. 18. He says it is used in dying:

‘⁴ Tingendis vestibus nascentes Ge- ,

5‘ nistae.’' I do not know that the
broom is ever used by our Dyers:
but another plant of the same kind is
much in use: they call» it wood-wax,
and green weed. It is the Coroneola
of Caesalpinus; and is called by
other authors Genista tinctona, Ge-

ηῐςίεἷῖα tinctoria, and Te‘nclorae‘zcsfloc.
I doubt not, but the Spanish broom
might be used sor the same purposes.

13. Populus] This no doubt is
the poplar, of which, according to
Pliny, there are three sorts: the
white, thelblack‚ and the Lybian,
which is our asp: ‘⁴ Populi tria ge-
‘⁶ nera, alba, nigra, et quae Lybica
‘⁶ appellatur, minima folio, ac niger-
‘⁶ 1·ima‚sungisque enascentibus lauda.
‘4 tissima.‘’

Glauca canentia fronde Sedecim]
This is a beautiful description of the
common willow: the leaves are of a.
blueissh green3 and the under side of
thern is covered with a white down.
He uses Salia-tum or Salio-etum the
place where willows grew, forSMIces,
the trees themselves.

15. Castaneoe.] The Castanea no
doubt is our chesnut. Pliny describes
the fruit very plainly: ‘⁶ Nuces vo.
‘⁶ camus et Castaneas, quanquam ac.
‘⁵ commodatiores glandium generi:
‘⁶ armatum iis echinato calyce vallum,
(ί quod inchoatum glandibus.’‘
