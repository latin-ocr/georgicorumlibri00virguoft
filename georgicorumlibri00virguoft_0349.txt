years: “ Verum neque ante ter-
‘⁴ tium, neque post quintum annum
“juvencos domari placet, quoniam
“ illa aetas adhuc tenera est, haec
‘⁶ jam praedura.'’ That author gives
a particular account of the manner
in which the ancients tamed their
bullocks, too lstng to be here inserted.
The reader may consult the second
chapter of the sixth book.

166. Laxos] In the King’s manu.
script, it is lapsos.

167. Dehine] In one of Dr.
Mead's manuscripts it is deinde.

168. Ipsis etot-quibus] This par-
ticular instruction, of fastening the
bullocks by the collars, may seem
superfluous to those, who are not in-
formed, that it was a custom among
the ancients, to yoak the bullocks to-
gether by the horns. This is men-
tioned by Columella, as being in use
in his days, in some of the provinces;
tho', he says, it wasjustly condemned
by most writers of agriculture:
‘⁶ Nam illud, quod in quibusdam
‘⁶ provinciis usurpatur, ut cornibus

‘⁶ illigetur jugum, sere repudiatum est-

“ ab omnibus, qui praecepta rusticis
‘⁶ conscripserunt, neque immerito:
‘⁶ plus erssm queunt pecudes collo
‘⁴ et pectore conari, quam cornibus.
“ Atque hoc modo tota mole cor-
f‘ poriS, totoque pondere nituntur:

ζ( at illa, retractis et resupinis capiti..
“ bus excruciantur, aegreque terra}
‘⁶ summam partem levi admodum
‘⁶ > vomere sauciant.”

‘⁵ In the most ancient oblong ma-
‘⁶ nuscript, it is de torquibus, in the
‘4 Lombard manuscript, it is ipsis et
‘⁵ torquibus apt05.'' Pmmus. In the
King's manuscript it is ex torquibus,
and in one of Dr. Mead’s, it is cam
torquibus. ·

Apios] The Criticks agree, that
(φὼς, iu this place, signifies the same
as aptatos or ligatos,- for it is derived
from ἄπ’]ω, to bc‘nd.

169. chnge pares ] Varro says yon

must yoak bullocks of eq ual strength,
lest the stronger should wear out

the weaker: ζ’· Ut viribus magnis
‘⁶ sint, ac pares, ne in opere firmior
‘4 imbecilliorem conficiat.” Colu-
mella also delivers the same precept:
‘⁶ Item custodiendum est, ne in cor.
‘⁶ poratione, vel statura, vel viribus
“impar cum valentiore jungatir:
‘⁶ nam utraque res inferiori celeri‘er
“ affert exitium.'’

170. Rom ducantur inanes] In
one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts it is
ducuntur.

By empty wheels is meant either
empty carriages, or wheels without
any carriage laid upon them. Varro
mentions drawing empty
