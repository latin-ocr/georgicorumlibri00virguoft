Castor is an animal substance taken
from a qumiruped, which in Latin
is called Castor and Faber, in English
the Beaver. It has been generally
imagined, that this drug is 1110 10511-
010 of that animal, and that, when it
is close pursucd, it bites off its 10511-
0105, 1011105 1110111 for the 1111111015, and
so escapes. To this story 1νο find
frequent allusions amongst 1110 an-
0101115; 111115 Juvenal:

‘6

 

Imitatus castora, qui 50

“ Eunuchum ipse facit, cupiens eva-
“ dere damno

‘⁶ Testiculorum.”

Pliny takes the castor to be the tes-
ticles of 1110 animal ; but quotes the
authority of Sextius, against the story
of it's biting 1110111 off. “ Specta-
“ bilis naturae potentia in 1115 quoque,
“ quibus 01 111 terris 01 111 aqua vic-
“ tus est, sicut 01 fibris quos castores
“ vocant, et castorea testes corum.
“ Amputari hos ab ipsis cum capian-
“ tur negat Sextius diligentissimus
“ medicinae. Quinimo parvos 0550

“ substrictosque, et adliaercntcs spinoe,
“nec adimi 51110 vita animalis posse.⁷’
Modern authors have discovered that
1110 bags 11111011 0011111111 1110 0115101·,’
are not 1110 testicles of 1110 Beaver,
and 111111 they 111110 110 communication
with 1110 penis, and are found in both
sexes. They are odoriferous glands
placed 111 1110 groin of 1110 Beaver,
as wc find 111 501110 other quadrupeds.
The best castor is now brought 10 115
froin Russia. Viro-sa does not mean
111 11115 place poi-soumis, but efficaciora
01· pou'eijizl. Virus, from which it
seems 10 bc derived, is sometimes
used in 11 good sense, as wc find itin
Statius:

“ -Jungam ipsc manus, atque omne
‘⁴ benigue

“ {fii-118, odoriferis Arabum quod
“ doctus in arvis,

‘⁴ Aut Amphrysiaco pastor de gra-
“ 1111110 carpsi.”

In the passage just now quoted from
1110 cighth eclogue we find the venena
of Pontus not 10 signify any thing
destructive to lif03 but drugs of
such extraordinary power, that by
their means Moeris could turn 111111-
self into a wolf, raise spirim, and re-
move a crop of corn from one field
to another.

Dryden lias followed the ancient
tradition of the testicles:

“ Thus Pontus sends her Beaver
“ stenes from far.'’
