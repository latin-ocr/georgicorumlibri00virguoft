P. VIRGILII MARONIS

Et quantum longis carpent armenta diebus, 201
Exigua tantum gelidus ros nocte reponet.
Nigra fere, et presso pinguis sub vomere terra,

NOTES.

201. Quantum longis, δια] What
the Poet here says of the prodigious
growth of the grass in assniglit’s time
seems incredible ; and yet we are
informed by Vari-0, that Caesar Vo-
piscus affirmed, that at Rosea, a
vine—pole being stuck in the ground
would be lost in the grass the next
day: “ Caesar Vopiscus AEdilicius,
“ causam cum ageret apud Censores,
“ campos Roseae Italiae dixit esse su-
“ men, in quo rtlicta pertica post-
“ridie non appareret propter her-
“ bam.” The same is >related by
Pliny, lib. 17. cap. 4.

203. Nigra feren] Columella
blames the ancient writers of hus-
bandry, for insisting upon a black or
grey colom, as a sign of a rich land :
‘⁶ Plurimos antiquorum, qui de rus-
“ ticis rebus scripserunt, memoria
“ repeto, quasi confessa, mc dubia
“ signa pinguis, ac frumentorum ser-
“ tilis agri prodidisse, dulcedinem
‘⁴ soli propriam herbarum et arbo-
⁸‘ rum proventum, nigrum colorem
“vel cinereum. De eaeteris ambi-
“ go, de colore satis admirari non
“ possum curn alios, tum Cornelium
‘⁶ Celsum, non solum agricolationis,
“ sed [uliversae naturae prudentem
“ virum, sic et sententia, et visu
“ deerrasse, ut oculis ej us tot paludes,
‘⁸ tot etiam campi salinarum non oc-
“ currerent, quibus rore contribuun-
“ tur praedicti colores. Nullum enim
“ temere videmus locum, qui modo
“pigrum contineat humorem, non
(ἐ eundem vel nigri, vel cinerei colo-

“ ris, nisi forte in eo fallor ipse, quod
“ non putem aut in solo limosae pa-
“ ludis, et uliginis amarae, aut in
“ maritimis areis salinarum gigni
“ posse jacta frumenta: sed est ma-
“ nisestior hic antiquorum error,
“ quam ut pluribus argumentis con-
“ vincendus sit: non ergo color,
“ tanquam certus antor, testis est
“ bonitatis arvorum.'’ virgil seems
to have been aware of this objection,
and therefore cautiously puts insere.
Mr. Evelyn however seems to recom-
mend a black earth, and such as is
here mentioned by the Poet: ‘⁶ The
“ best is black, fat, yet porouS, light,
“ and sufficiently tenacioris, without
“ any mixture of sand or gravei, ris-
“ ing in pretty gross clods at the first
“ breaking up oftheplougl13 but with
“ little labour and exposure falling
“ to pieces, but not crumbling alto-
“ gether into dust, which is the de-
“ fect of a vicious sort. Of this ex·-
“ cellent black niould (fit almost for
“ any thing without much manure)
“ there are three kinds, which differ
‘⁴ in hue and goodness.''

Pressa pinguis suh vomere terra]
A rich land is universally allowed to
be good for corn. virgil here says
the soil should be deep, so as to be
fat, even below the share that makes
a deep furrow ; presso sub vomere. I ἶ
take the epithet presso to allude to the
custom of laying a weight on the ἦ
head of the plough, to make the share '
enter deeper.
