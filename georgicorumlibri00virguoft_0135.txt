GEORG. LIB. Ι.

Nec fratris radiis obnoxia surgereLuna :
Tenuia nec lanae per caelum vellera ferri.
Non tepidum ad solem pennas in littore pandunt
Dilectae Thetidi Alcyones ε non ore-solutos

NOTES.

396. Nec fratris radiis obnoxia
surgere tamt] Servius thinks that
obtusa is to be understood here ε and
that the sense is': ‘⁶ For then neither
⁶⁶ does the* light of the stars seem
⁶⁶ dim, nor that of the moon, which
⁶⁶ is beholden to her brother’sbeam.'’
Ruaeus seems to have found the true
meaning of this passage3 that ⁶⁶ the
‘⁶ moon rises with such an exceeding
“ brightneSS‚ that ene would rather
⁶⁶ think her light to be her own, then
⁶⁶ only borrowed from the sun.”
See Aulus Gellius, l. 7. c. 17.

397. Tenum nec lanoe per coelum
vellera ferri] By thz'n fleeces of
wool the Poet means thefleecy clouds,
which Aratus mentions as a sign of

rain ε

manuscripts it is mc.

399. Dilectoe Thetidi Halcyones]
The fable of Ceyx and his wife Hal-
cyone being turned into these birds is
beautifuiiy‘ related in the eleventh
book ovaid’s Metamorphoses. The
>mutual love of these persons mxbsistcd
after their change, in honour of which9
,the gods are said to have ordaiucd,
that‘ whilst they sit on their nest,

which floats on the sea, there should
be no storm. Some say this lasts se-
ven dayS‚ others nine, others eleven,
and others fourteen. Ovid mentions
seven ε
