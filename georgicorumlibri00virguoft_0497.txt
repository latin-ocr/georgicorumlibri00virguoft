The altars of Ιῐὶιεῖ gods are of-
ten adorned with wreaihs of
these flowers. Ιι lias a bitter-
ish teste. The shepherds ga-
ther it in the open rames, and
near the winding stream of the
river Mella. Boil the roots of
this herb in the best flavoured
wine, and place baskets full of

9-80 them before the door uf ιὶις

Novis,

⁶⁶ {hle flow’r itself is of a golden
u
‘⁶ ngllbel leaves inclining to a darker
⁶⁶ The klgzives shoot thick about the
⁶⁶ flow’r, and grow
⁶⁶ Into a bush, and shade the turs
‘⁶ below.'⁷

Dryden took the folia quoe plurima
circumfunduntur to be the branchos
of the plant:

⁶⁶ For from one root the rising stem
‘⁶ bestows

⁶⁶ A wood of leaves, and vi'let purple
‘⁶ boughs : -

⁶⁶ The flow’r itself is glorious to be-
‘⁶ hold,

⁶⁶ And shines on altars like refulgent

⁶⁶ gold.’'

Dr. Trapp supposes the stem to be
golden, and the leaves to be purple :

‘⁶ For from one turs a mighty grove
‘⁶ it bears : ,

‘⁶ Its stem of golden hue, but in its
⁶⁶ leaves,

⁶⁶ Which copious roundit sprout7 the
⁶⁶ purple teint

⁶⁶ Of deep-dy'd violets more glossy
⁶⁶ shines.‘’

275. Violae nigrae] The com-

mon violet. It is called black, from
its dark purple colour. Thus Theo..

interprets this non syl-cosas. ⁶⁶ Unde,
⁶⁶ says he, estcontra intonsi montes.’'
La Corda takes it to mean aster
mozoz'ng: ⁶⁶ Cum valles jam sunt
⁶⁶ tonsae, 82 demessae segete5.’' Ser-
vius's sense agrees hest with the ac..
count which Ray gives of the place
where it grows. Ruaeus follows La
Cerda, rendering this passage in pra-
tis demessis. Dr. Trapp adheres to
this interpretation.

278. FluminaMellae.] One osthe
Arundelian manuscripts, and the
Cambridge manuscript have it Amel-
ἴα». La Cerda reads Meloe. There
are several rivers of this name3 but
that which Virgil means here is a
rive( of Lombardy.

280. Appone.] Pierius tells us
that itis erpone in the Roman, and
some other manuscripts.
