ν But those who are completely
carefui, choose out the same
sort of soi! to plant the young
cuttings of their tree53 and to
remove them into afterwards i
that the slips may not think
their new mother strange·

Mutatam ignorent subito ne semina matrem.

NOTES.

Vir-gil speaks of making deep fur. and not a ‘crop, for it is applied to

rows, he expresses it by saying the
bullocks must be strong: so here he
expresses the depth of the trenches
by saying the labourer must be

strong.
266. Prima paretur arboribus se.

gem] By prima seges he means the
seminarium, or nursery, where the
cuttings of the vines are first plant..
ed. Dr. Trapp interprets seges,
those planta which spring from seed ‚-
but vines are seldom, if ever, propa-
gated by seed. Seges is sometimes
used by Virgil for a crop, thus we
have lim· seges for a crop offlam.- but
he uses it often also for the field it.

In ver. 129. of the fourth Georgick‚
ceges is very evidently used forblcmd‚

cattle as well as vines:

“ Nec fertilis illa juvencis,
‘⁶ Nec pecori opportuna seges, nec

“ commoda Bacch0.‘’

 

267. Quo mox: digesta seratum]
By these words he means the vineyard,
into which the young vines are to be
removed from the nursery, and where
they are to continue.

In the Bodleian manuscript it is
egestu, instead of digesta.

268. Matutam ignorent subito ne
semina matrem] In the King's, the
Cambridge, the Bodleian, and both
Dr. Mead’s manuscripts it is mutata.
I find the same reading in most of the
old editions, in Paul Stephens, La
Cerda, and several others. Both the
Arundelian manuscriptS, Heinsius,
Ruaeus, Masvicius, and several other
good editors read mutatam.
