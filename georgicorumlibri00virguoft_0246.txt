Ρ. VIRGILII MARONIS

Nam saepe incautis pastoribus excidit ignis,
Qui furtim pingui primurn sub cortice tectus
Robora comprendit, frondesque elapsus in altas
Ingentem caelo sonitum dedit.
Per ramos victor, perque alta cacumina regnat,
Et totum involvit flammis nemus‚et ruit atram
Ad caelum picea crassus caligine nubemts.
Praesertim si tempestas a vertice sylvis
Incubuit, glomeratque ferens incendia ventus.
Hoc ubi, non a stirpe valent, caesaeque reverti
Possunt, atque ima similes revirescere terra:
Infelix superat foliis oleaster amaris.

N ec tibi tam prudens quisquam persuadent

NOTES.

ports to the vines. This the poet just-
ly reprehends, because a spark, light-
ing accidentally on the unctuous bark
of the olive, may set the whole vine-
yard on fire. May seems to under-
stand this precept of Virgil to relate
to the planting of wild olives, not
amongst the vines, but amongst the
cultivated olives: for his translation

is thus:

 

“ Nor yet
‘⁶ Wild olixe trees amongst other
“ olives set.'’

310. A vertice] Servius, Grimoai-
dus, and, after them, Ruaeus‚ think
that by α vertice is meant from the
north3 because that pole appears
above our heads: hic vertex nobis
semper sublimis, ButsI rather believe
it means only from above: for the
most furious winds do not come from
the north: and in the first Geor-
gick, we have the south wind men.
tioued to come ab alto.- which is it

be taken to mean from high, as some
understand it, cannot surely be in-
terpreted of the north pole:

Namque urget ab alto
‘⁶ Arboribusque satisque notus, pe.
“ corique sinister.”

 

See the note on book I. ver. 324.

31⁶2. Non a stirpe valent] They are
the vines, which he says are destroyed
scr ever3 sor he mentions the wild

covering themselves.

315. Nec tibi, &c.] Here we have
a precept relating to the time of plant-
ing vine53 which is either in the spring
or autumn ; from which the Poet
beautifully slides into a most noble
description os the spring.

316. M'o’eer22] So itisin the Roman
manuscript, according to Pierius, who
prefers this reading to movere, as it
is in the other copieS. Heinsius also

has moveri.
