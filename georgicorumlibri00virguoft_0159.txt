Dignus honos : squalent abductis arva colonis,
Et cumae rigidum falces conflantur in ensem.
Hinc movet Euphrates,illinc Germania bellum:

Arma ferunt: saevit toto Mars impius qlssbe.
Ut qum carceribus sese effudere qnadrigae,
Addunt in spatio, et frustra retinacula tendens

503. Et cur-cce rigi-'lum falces con-
flentur in ensem] We have an ex-
pression much like this in the prophet
Joel: ‘⁶ Beat your plow-shares into
“ swords, and your pruning hooks
‘⁶ into spears.’'

509. Hinc movet Euphrates, illinc
Germania bellum] This part of the
Georgicks must have been written,
whilst Augustus and Anthony were
drawing together their forces, to pre-
pare for that war, which was decided
by the defeat of Anthony and Cleo.
patra, at Actium. Anthony drew-
his forces from the eastern part of the
empire, which Virgil distinguishes by
the rii-er Euphrates: Augustus drew
his from the western parts, which he
expresses hy Germany.

510. Vicinoe ruptis inter scu] The
Cambridge manuscript has Vz'cinoe ἱηζ
ter se raptis jam.

512. Ut cum carceribus sese effic-
dere quadrigae] Thus Horace:

Ut cum carceribus missos rapit ungula
currus.

513. Addunt in spania] This pas..

sage is variously read, and almost as
variously interpreted. Some read ad.
dunt se in spatio, which is not very
easy to be understood. Both theA run-
delian manuscrintS,and several printed
editions, have adala-mse in spatia. But
se is left out in the King’s, the Cam-
bridge, the Bodleian, and both Dr.
Mead's manuscript53 also in the Me-
dicean, and several other ancient ma-
nuscripts, according to Pierius. La
Cerda endeavours to prove that spa..
tizam signifies the turning round the me-
ta, which was usually performed seven
times3 and that addere se in spatia
or addere in epatica signifies the often
turning round, and adding one circle
to another. But Virgil seems to me
to mean by spatium the whole space
that was allotted for thecourse. Thus,
at the end of the second Gemgick,
whose he alludes to a chaum-mee,
he says,

(ί -—- Immensum spatiis confeci.
‘⁶ mus aequor.”

which can relate only to the vast cir-
cumference of the whole ring. That
passage in the third Georgick is to be
understood in the same manner,
where he is speaking offa good horse:

‘⁵ llic, vel ad Elei metas et maxima
‘⁵ campi

‘f sudabit spatia.‘’ I
