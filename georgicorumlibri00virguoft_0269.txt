NOTES.

Dryden has taken no notice of <lente
unco in his translation:

‘⁴ The soil itself due nourishment
‘⁶ supplies3

‘⁶ Plow but the furrows, and the
-“· fruits arise.'’

425. IIoa] IIoc seems to relate
to vomere, as Mr. B observes:
it is usually interpreted propter hoc.

426. Pomm] I take this to belong
to fruit-trees in general. Columella,
in his chapter De arboribus pomrferis,
speaks of figs, pomegranates‚ apples,
pears, mulberries, aud several other
sorts of fruits. The poet says they
require no care but ingrasting3 for
that is the sense of truncos sensere
calentes. Ad sidera raptim ‘ce' propria
nituntur is much the same expression
as

 

-“ Exiit in 'caelum ramis felicibus
55 arbosf’

429. Nec minus? δικ] Here he
speaks of wild trees, which grow in
the woqu.

431. Tondentur cytisi] A consi.
derable number of· different plants
have been supposed by different au-
*hors to be the cytisus here spoken

of: but the szlisus Marcmthoe is ge-
nerally allowed to «be the plant. We
can gather nothing certain from what
virgil has said about it. Ile mentions
goats as being very fond of it, in the
first eclogae ε

 

“ 7Non me pascente capellae
⁶2 Florentem cytisum, et salices car-
‘⁴ petis amaras :'’

And in the Second:

‘² Torvaleaenalupum sequitur, lupus
‘4 ipse capellam:

‘⁵ Florentem cytisum sequitur lasciva
‘4 capella:

“ Te Corydon, o Alexi:³'

which seems to be an imitation of the
following lines, in the tenth Idymum
of Theocritus:

A αἲξ τὸν niveam, ὅ λύκος τὰν αἶψα,
ἑκών-Εὖ,

‘A γέρανος τῦροτρον. ἐγὼ δ’ ἐπὶ τὶν μεμοί-
νημαι.

The Greek Poet also mentions the

goats as eating cytisus, in the fifth
ldyllium: Ι

Ta) μὲν ἐμαὶ uzi-meh τε καὶ ἄιγιλον σ’ἱίγες

ἕδοντι.
