GEORG. LIB. Ι.

Certatim largos humeris infundere rores;
N unc caput objectare fretis, nune currere in undas,
Et studio incassum videas gestire lavandi.
Tum cornix plena pluviam vocat improba voce,
Et sola in sicca secum spatiatur arena.

N ec nocturna quidem carpentes pensa puellae

The country about this river, being
marshy, abounds with water-fowl.
Swans are frequently mentioned by
the Poets: Homer, in the passage to
which we just now referred, speaks
of geese, cranes, and swans ε

some of the ancient manuscripts have
mulis, and others mulas. (Jne of
Dr. Mead’s manuscripts has ιιηεῖἰε,
and the other has undam.

388. Tum cornix plena, ἃς]
The crow is mentioned also by
Aratus:

¹The ancients thought that crows not
only predicted rain but- called it.

Thus Lucretius, speaking of the dif-
ferent yoices of birds z

Sometimes at change of alr, they
change their voice:

Thus ἄατος, ancl 0m⁷nozcs erotem, with
various nois-e,

Servius reads rauca instead of plena;
but plena is generally allowed to be

the true reading.
The Bodleian and one of the Arun-

delian manuscripts, after ver. 388,
have

‘⁶ Aut caput objectat querulum ve-
“ nientibus undis.”

The. King's and one of Dr. Mead’s

manuscripts have et caput, ἃς. ἵξῃ
