is membranaceous, long, and of a ί( propter anni tempus, media plane

dark colour, Hence we may bc sure,
that some species of our Daffodil is

*the Narcissus of the Ancients: and
probably the Narcissus albas circulo
purpureo C. B. and tho Narcissus al-
bus circulo croceo minor C. B. may
be the two sorts. The last of these
seems to be the flower, into which
the youth Narcissus was changed,
according to Ovid:

‘C

 

Croceum pro corpore florem

‘⁶ Inveniunt, foliis medium cingenti-
“ bus albis.”

There seems to bc but one difficulty
attending this determination: thc
species of Da'ffodil known among us,
ssower early in the spring, and seldom
later than in May3 whereas Theo-
pin-astus, Virgil, and Pliny, place
their season in September. But to
this' it may be answercd, that in
Greece, these flowers may appear
much later in the year. Busbequius
says he was presented with Daffodils
near Constantinople, in December3
and that Greece abounds with Hya-
cinths and Daffodils of a wonderful
fragrance: ί( Unum diem Hadria-

Tournefort found the yellow Daffo.b
dil common on the banks of the
Granicus, in December, and another
sort about the same time, near
Ephesus, ⁷

already mentioned the Acantlmw, in
the note on book II. ver. 119. It
has been there observed that there
are two sorts of Acanthus3 one an
Egyptian tree, and the other a garden
herb, which the poet means in this
place. The Acanthus of Theophras-
tus is the Egyptian tree, of which
we have spoken already. The herb
Acanthus is described by Dioscorides·
He says the leaves are much longer
and broadcr than those of Lettuce,
divided like Rocket, blackish, fat,
and smooth: the stalli is two cubits
high, of the thickness of one’s finger,
smooth, eticonipassed near the top at
certain distances with long, prickly
leaves, out of which proceeds a white
flower: the seed is long and yellow:
the roots are long, mucous, red, and
glufmous: ''Auaron- ἠ {pratumqu- οἵ
