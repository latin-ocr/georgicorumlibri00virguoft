Husbandry3 he concludes this se-
cond Georgick, with observing that
this was the life which their glorious
ancestors led3 that this was the em-
ployment of Saturn, in the golden
age, before mankind were grown
wicked, and had learned the art of
war.

Veteres Sabini] The Sabines were
an ancient people of Italy, near Rome.
They were famous for religion and
virtue: and are thought by some to
derive their name ἀπὸ τῖς σέίὲεσὲαι,
from worshipping. Thus Pliny:
⁶‘ Sabini, ut quidam existimavere, a
“ religione et deorum cultu Sebini
“ appellati.” It is customary with
the Poets to compare achaste, virtuous,
matron, to the Sabine women. Thus
Horace:

‘⁶ Quod si pudica mulier in partem
⁶⁶ juvans
‘⁶ Domum, atque dulces liberos:
⁶⁶ Sabina qualis, aut perusta solibus
“ Pernicis uxor Appuli.'’
