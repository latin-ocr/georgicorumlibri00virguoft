NOTES.

Pis-au] Strabo tells us, that it
has been questioned, whether there
ever was such a city as Pisa, affirm-
ing it to have been the name only

fessed however, that it was ancient-
ly the name of a country in that
part of Elis, through which the ri-
ver 'Alpheus flowed, and in which
stood the famous temple of Jupiter
Olympius,

181. Et Jovis z'n lecca] In one of
Dr. Mead’s manuscripts, it is siin-
stead of et.

The Commentators seem to have
passed over this grove of Jupiter in
silence. We learn however from
Strabo, that it belonged to the tem-
ple of Jupiter Olympius. Ile says
the Olympian temple is in the Pisean
region, not quite three hundred stadia.
from the city Elis3 that it has a
grove of wild olives before it in
which is a place sor races: Λοιπὸν

185. Lanos] I have translated
lztzws ί] umpets for want of a proper
English word. The taba is gene-
rally thought to have been the
same instrument with our trzcmpet:
but the lituus was different from it,
being almost straight, only turning
a little in at the end: the corma
and the buccinum were bent almost
round.

184. Stabulo froenos audire somm-
les] In one of D1. Mead’s manu.
scripts it is stabuli-,s

V arro also says the colts should be
accustomtd to the sight and sound
of bridles: ‘⁶ Eademque causa ibi
‘⁶ sraenos suspendendum, ut equuli
‘⁴ consuescant et videre eorum sa-
‘⁴ ciem, et e motu audire crepitus. ”

189. Invcclzdus] ln the King’s
manuscript it is im (deciusque.

Etjam. ] Sol read with Heinsius.
Pierius found the same reading in
some ancient copie.s The common
reading is eliam.
