NOTES.

is derived from ιζ’ω, to raim, because
they are thought to bring rain, at
their rising and setting. The old
Romans, thinking hyades to be ‹le—
rived froin ὗς, α sow, called these stass
sucidae,- as we are infor-med by (fi-
ceroz “ Ejus (Tauri) caput stellis
‘⁶ conspersum est frequentibus:

“ Haec Graeci stellas: Hyadas voci-
“ tare suerunt:

“ A pluendo: ὕειν 0111111 est pluere.
“ Nostri imperite suculam quasi a
“ suibus essent, 11011 1111 imbribus no-
“ minatae.” Pliny makes the 5111110
observation: “ Quod nostri a 51111111-
“ tudine. cognominis Graeci propter
“ sues impositum arbitrantes, impe-
⁴⁶ ritia appellavere suculas.’' Servius
mentions another etymology, that
these stars represent the form of the
Greek letter Υ, and are therefore
called Ὑάδες. Itis certain that the
five principal stand in the shape of
that letter. Callisto, the daughter
of Lycaon, was violated by Jupiter,
and turned into a bear by Jun0. Ju-
piter afterwards translated her into
the constellation called by the Greeks
Ἄρκτος, by the Romans Ursa major,
and by us the Great Beazr. See the

whole fable, in the second book of ‘⁶

Ovid’ s Metammphosis.

139. Laqueis. ] It 15 laqueo ln one
of Dr. Mead’ s manuscripts

140, Inventum, et magnos] In one
of the Arundelian manuscripts, it 15
inventam: wmgnos. ln 0110 of Dr.
Mead's, it is inventum est: magnos.

Canibus circumdare saltus] 'rhus
we have in the tenth Eclogue:

“ Non me ulla vetabunt
‘⁴ lhigora Parthenios canibus circum-
“ dare saltus.’'

 

141. Verberat amnem] This lash-
ing the river is a beautiful description
of the manner of throwing the cast-
ing net.

141. Alta ραι-,ηε ] Servius tells us
that some make the point after am-
nem; and make alta petens to belong
to the sea-fishing. But 111 11115 case,
1 believe virgil would hardly have
put the que after pelago: I believe the
line would rather have run thus: s

‘⁴ Alta petens alius pelago trahit Ιιυ-
“ mida linas

Humida lium] La Cerda observes
that linum is often used sor a net. M r.
Β- says “ The sea-fishing is finely
“ painted3 for in this business 1110
“ 111105 are so long, by reason of the
“ depth of the water, that the 13151101·-
man’s employment seems to be no-
“ thing else but trahifflmmida linax'

uffords to express the drag-”gib or
