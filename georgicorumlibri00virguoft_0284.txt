493. Fortunatus et illa] Here the
Poet compares the happiness, which
results from the innocence os a coun-
try life, to that which is obtained by
Philosophy. Cicero in his treatise
on old aee, says the life of a husband-
man approaches very near to that of
'a philosopher: ‘⁶ Mihi ad sapientis
‘⁶ vitam proxime videtur accedere.'’
Columella says it is nearly related to
Philosophy : ‘⁶ Ros rustica sinedubi-
‘⁶ tatione proxima, et quasi consan-
“ guinea sapientiae est.”

494. Panaque] Pan is the chief
of the rural denies,

syl-„unumque senem] See the note
on boel< Ι. ver. ΞΟ.

Nymphasque sorores] There were
several sorts of nymphs: the Naiads
presided over rivers 3 the Nereids over
scas ; the Oreads over mountains 3
the Dryads over woods, &c.

495. Populi sus-cesi] The fasces
were bundles of birchen rods, in the
midst of which was placed an aX,
with the head appearing at the top.
They were the ensigns of authority,
and were carried before the Roman
magistrates, We learn from Diogenes
Laertius, that Epicurus avoided pub-
lick offices out of modesty: ’Υπερςολῇ
γὰξ ἐπιεικείας, ὃυδέ πολιτείας ἥψατο.
Cicero also seems to insinuate, that

the Epicurean Philosophy persuaded ’

men not to engage in publick busi-
ness: ‘⁶ Nec ulla tamen ei Philo..
‘⁶ sophiae fiet injuria a nobis. Non
‘⁶ enim repelletur inde, quo ag-
‘⁶ gredi cupiet: sed in hortulis qui.
‘⁶ escet suis, ubi vult3 ubi etiam
“ recubans, molliter, et delicate,
‘⁶ nos avocat a rostris, a judiciis, α
“ curia.- fortasse sapienter, hac prae.
“ sertim republica.’' Virgil observes,
that, if this retirement from public
affairs is to be accounted a part of
happiness, the countryman enjoys it

abundantly. He does not seek after ¹

magistracies, nor courts3 he has no.
thing to do with discord, nor con..
cerns himself about foreign conspi-
rames.

497. conjurato descendens Dacus
ab Istra] The Danube or Ister is
the largest river in Europe: several
different natIOns dwelling on it's
banks. The ancients called this ri-
