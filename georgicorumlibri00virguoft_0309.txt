in this very Georgiok‚ of which La
Cerda has quoted but the half part,
where Mycmae, a city also of Argia,
is celebrated equally with Epirus z

“ Et patriam Epirum referat, fortes.

· I am persuaded that Ruaeus is in the
right, by a passage in Strabo, where
he says Epidaurus is famous for horses:

Strabo cannot well be understood to
r speak in thiS place of any other, than
the Peloponnesian Epidaurus.

46. Mox tamen ardentes accingar,
&0.] In the King’s manuscript it is
etiam instead οἵ tamen.

Here he is generally understood to
mean, that he intends, as soon as he
has finished the Georgicks‚ to describe
the wars of Augustus, under the
character of AEneas. Mr. B— is
quite of another opinion: “This
“ passage‚’' ‘⁴ he says, the commen-
‘⁶ tators understand of the AEueid3
‘⁶ but it is plainly meant of the fourth
“ Georgick. There he describes the
‘⁶ ardentes pugnas, the civil wars
“ betwixt the same people for the
‘⁶ sake of rival kingS. In this
“ sense the passage is very sublime,
“ to promise to introduce such a
{⁶ matter in talkingvof bees3 but in

‘4 one Poem to promise another
‘⁵ is low, and unworthy of virgil,
‘⁴ and what never entered into'
‘³ his imagination,⁷' But surely
ΜΓ. Β must be mistaken in this
piece of Criticism‚ for the whole in-
troduction to this Georgick is apre-
lude to the [Eneid2 and I do not
see how the fig'nts of the bees
can be understood to be a descrip-
tion of the wars of Caesar3 which
the Poet expressly says he designs to
sing.

48. Tithoni prima quot abest ab
origine Coesar.] Servius interprets
this passage, that the fame of Augus-
tus shall last as many years, ag
were from the beginning of the world
to his time. He thinks Tithonus
is put for the sun, that is, for
Tithan. Others understand the Poet
to mean that the fame of Augustus
shall last as many years, as were
from Tithonus, the son of Laomedon,
to Augustus. But to this is objeC«

tion sor the Poet to promise² being.
no more than a thousand years. And
indeed the fame of Virgil’s Poem,
and of Augustus, has lasted much
longer already. Servius seems to have
no authority for making Tithonus
signify the suu: nor can we imagine
Virgil means the sun, unless we
suppose Tithoni to be an erroneous
reading for Titani, or Titanis. But
I do not know that so much as one
manuscript countenances this altera-
tion. Itmust therefore beTithoan
