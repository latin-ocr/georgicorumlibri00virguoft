GEORG. LIB. ΙΙ.

Ferrea progenies duris caput extulit arvis :
Immissaeque ferae sylvis, et sidera caelo.

Nec res hunc tenerae possent perferre laborem,
Sinon tanta quies iret frigusque caloremque
Inter, et exciperet caeli indulgentia terras. 345

NOTES.

editions have cum primoe. The com-
mon reading is cz-zm primum.

341. Ferrea] Some read terrea,
on the authority of Lactantius: but
it may as well be supposed, that it is
an error in the copy of Lactantius.
virgil seems to have imitated Hesiod:

Νῦν γὰρ δὴ ’γένος ἔςῖ σεδ-ἕρξον.

Duris] In some of the old edi-
tions it is durum.

Arvas] In the Bodleian manu-
script it is armis,

Ruaeus thinks the Poet here al-
ludes to the iron age, and the resti-
vtution of the earth by Deucalion and
Pyrrha, as was related in the note on
ver. 62. of the first Georgick. ssut
that learned commentator seems to
have forgotten3 that virgil is here
speaking of the very first age of the
world.

344. S ἰ mm tanta quies iret, Sca]
In the old Nurenberg edition it is
“ Si non tanta quies inter frigusque
‘5 caloremque iret.”

345. Exciperet] In one os Dr:
Mead’s manuscripts it is laoec pareret.

346. Quod superest, <5ch T he
Poet now proceeds to give directions,
about layers: and recommends dung-
ing, and laying stenes and shells at
the roots.

Premes] Servius interprets this
demerges, infodies. Hence most of
the Commentators have agreed to
understand the Poet to speak ofplant-
ing in general. ΜΓ. B— is sin-
gular in understauding virgultapre-
mere to helmeant of luyers:

<4 Now, when you bend the layers to
‘² the ground.''

this however I take to be Virgil's
sense. We have seen at the begin-
ning of this book, that he recom-
mends layers, as the best way of pro-
pagating vines: Propagine vites re-
spondent.- to this method of propa-
gating therefore it is most probable
that he should allude. And besides
premere seems more proper to express
the laying down a branch9 than the
planting of a cutting or removing of
a young tree. La Corda interprets
virgulta premere, infodere surculos in
scrobz'bzcs7and endeavours to strength-
enit with two quotminus, neither of
which seem to meto answer his pur-
pose. The firstis from Caius: “Quod
‘⁶ si vicini arborem in terra presserim,
‘⁴ utin meum fundum radices egerit.⁷’
Caius speaks here plainly of layum.
He says a tree is the property of
that person, in whose ground it
strikes root: aud therefore if I lay it
