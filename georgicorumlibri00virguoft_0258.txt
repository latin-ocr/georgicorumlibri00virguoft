NOTES.

‘⁶ cepit.'' It is easy to see that S. Isi..
dore took what he says, in this quo·
tation, from 1116 following passage of
Pliny: ‘⁶ Faciunt his sidem in ltalia
‘⁶ appellatae boae: in tantam ampli-
“ tudinem exeuntes, ut, Divo Clau-

‘⁶ dio principe, occisae in Vaticano
ιι

solidus in alvo aspectatus sit insanis.
<c

Aluntur primo bubuli lactis succo,
‘⁶ unde nomen traxere.‘’ It is high-
ly probable, that the good bishop read
bubula· in Pliny, instead of the ad-
jective bubuli: and therefore we
cannot inser tha( the Busalo was an-
ciently called Babulus.

in the Cambridge, the Bodleian, both
1116 Arundelian, and both Dr. Mead’s
manuscripts.

Servius renders sequetem, persecu-
trebes. It §signilies pursuing with de-
sire3 thus, in the second eelogue:

It is caproe

‘4 Florentem cytisum seqnitur lasciva
‘⁶ capella,

‘4 He now explains more fully what
‘⁶ he had said before, and shews what
‘⁶ are 1110116 cruel winters, what the
‘⁴ powerful suns, what the injury of
‘⁶ beasts. Aa if he should say, I said
‘⁶ that the cattle did more harm 1ο
“ vineyards than cruel winters, or
‘⁶ scorching suns: for neither the
‘f colds stiffwith hoary frost (here is

‘⁶ the cruelty of winter), nor the
‘⁶ burning heats beating upon the
‘⁵ scorching rocks (here is the power-
‘4 ful sun), do so much barm as
‘4 those cattle: 101111611- bite is full
‘⁶ of poison, and may be called a sear,
‘⁶ or ulcer, rather than a bite.” LA

377. Gravis incumbens scopulis a..
rentibus mansu] In 1116 Cambridge
manuscript it is ardentibus instead of
arentibus. In the King's, and one
of Dr. Mead's manuscripts itis cestus
instead of (estas. See the note on
book I. ver. 312. and book II. ver.
322.

Servius interprets incumbens sco-
pulis, Etiam saxa caloribus penetrum,
in which sense he is followed by
Ruaeus and Mayz

(ί And parching suns, that burn 1116
“ hardest rocks :''

And Dryden τ

‘⁶ Nor dog-<lays parching heat, that
‘⁶ splits the rocks:”

And Mt. B—-:

‘⁶ Not raging heats that pierco {hro’
‘² 'thirsty rocks :”

And Dr. Trapp:

‘⁶ Nor summer, when it drys and
