that, Ister. Virgil therefore calls it
the Ister with great propriety‚ be..
cause the Dacians inhabit the lower
parts of it, not far from its falling
into the Euxine sea.

The Dacians inhabited those parts,
which are now called Transylvania,
Moldavia, and Walachia. It is said,
they had a custom of filling their
’ mouths with the water of this river,
before they undertook any war, and
swearing that they would not return
into their own country, till they had
slain their enemieS. Therefore Vir-
gil calls it the conspiring Ister, be-
cause the Dacians were accustomed
to conspire after this manner on the
banks of the river Ister.

placed a great happiness in being free
from perturbations of the mind, of
which pity and envy are not the least.
This happiness the husbandman en-
joys, for, in the country, nature pro-
duces so many necessaries of life,
that there can be no objects of pity:
and his life is so happy in itself, that
he has no temptation to envy any
one. Servius, and after him most
of the Commentators, take Virgil to
speak here of a Stoical Apathy, in
which sense Dryden seems to hare
translated him:
