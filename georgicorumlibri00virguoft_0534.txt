The following REMAnxs were sent me, after the publication of the Third

Georgick‚ by the learned Eowmn Kme, Esq3 in a Letter dated from

Bromlcy in Kent, N ov· 20, 1740.

EORGICK I. ver. 48. It is
the cheapest and best way of
improving land in the old husbandry:
but then it must be ploughed more
than four times.

Ver. 97. Mr. B-’s remark is
wrong in another particular3 for
when these chinks are thus filled up,
and then corn sowed, there will not
he fine monld enough to cover the
seed. Virgil does not speak of sow-
ing in this place.

Ver. ⁶208. W'hcn Libra has made
the day and honrs of sleep equal.

Ver. 3527. The limbs of the trees
being dry *inm-cases the sriction and
noise, when they rub against each
other, and makes this aridus fragor.
There would be nofmgor if the trees
were wet: for that would take off
the friction.

Ver. 403. Virgil here speaks of
the signs of fair weather. Nequz‘c-
quam translated in vain, and appli-
ed to the owl’s singing, suits but ill
with Virgil’s exactness3 for that
would be making him say, that the
owl's singing, which is a sign of foul
woather‚ is a vain omen, because it
will be fair: it is saying that one
sign os foul weather, is not a sign of
foul weather. But Virgil has not
been guilty os any thing like this in'
his tokens of foul or fair weather.
He says before Now-acres radiis οἰμ-Δ

noxia luna: which in the familiar
English expression is, The moon riser
as brz‘glzt as day. It seems to me
therefore, that there should be a stop
at nequicquam, and then the sense
will run thus 3 The ozel from tlte top
of the roos observes (or waits) the
settc’ng of the sun ἱη vain, because the
m’glzt will be poetically as hriglzt as
day. Ser-os cantus is peculiar to the
owl‚ I know no bird besides, that
sings only in the night. The nigh-
tingales with us sing in the day-time
from about the middle of May, to the
time they leave us- This perhaps
has not been attended to, because her
voice in the day-time is drowned in
the. neighbouring chorus. Thus
most will readily say that mos..
soms are antecedent to leaves,
but upon examination will find,
that leaves are equally fori-rard
(at the same tIme) in proportion
to their full growth‚ with blossoms
in respect to the fruit that follows
thern as in the Peach‚ Nectarine,¹A1..
mond, &c. The glaring appearance
of the bloom takes up all the com-
mon attenti-ong as the chirping‚
whistling, discord notes of various
other birds divort the undistinguishing
ear from attending to the single
part of the musical nightingale.
KVc are only apt to consider her
Solo part per amica silentia Lu.
