NOTES.

⁶⁶ nobis vel a frugibus natis amo-
‘⁶ veantur, Averruncus quoque ha-
‘⁶ betur et Robigus.” Grimoaldus
also has paraphrased the passage be-
fore us according to this interpreta-
tion: ⁶⁶ ld quod praestare me posse
‘⁶ reor, dummodo Dii adversi pla-
‘⁶ cabuntur, ita ut ne obsint, et
‘⁶ Apollo Poetarum amicus, a me
⁶⁶ invocatus adesse voluerit, ita ut
‘⁶ prosit.'' This is also approved by
La Cerda and Ruaeus. Dr. Trapp's
translation also is in this sense:

‘⁶ ——· Small the argument: not
‘⁶ small

‘⁶ The glory3 if the unpropitious
⁶⁶ pow’rs

⁶⁶ Oppose not, aud Apollo hears
‘⁶ our praj'rJ’

‘⁶ The word loeva,'' says this learn-
ed Gentlernan, ⁶⁶ may siguisy either
‘⁶ propitians, or the direct contrary.
⁶⁶ Π the former3 sinunt must mean
⁶⁶ permit by assis-ling ε if the other3
‘⁶ permit by not lcindere'ng. 'l'he
“latter is certainly, upon all ac-
“ counts the better-'³

The Romans generally esteemed
omens appearing on the left hand, as
good: but this rule did not obtain
universally among their augu rs 3 sor
Cicero in his first book (le Divina-
tione, informs us, that a raven ou
the righthand, and a crow on the lest,
were looked upon as sure omens:
⁶⁶ Quid augur, cur a dextra corvus,
⁶⁶ a sinistra cornix saciat ratum ?''
In his second book he speaks of thun.

der from the left being accounted
prosperous in the Roman augury, and
observes, that the Greeks and Bar-
barians preferred the right hand, but
the Romans the left: ⁶⁶ Quae autem
⁶⁶ est inter augures conveniens et
⁶⁶ conjuncta constantia? ad nostri
⁶⁶ augurii consuetudinem dixit En-
⁶⁶ nius,

‘⁶ Cum tonuit laevum bene tempes-
⁶⁶ tate serena.

⁶⁶ At Homericus Ajax apud Achil-
⁶⁶ lem quereus de ferocitate-'l‘roja-
⁶⁶ norum nescio quid, hoc modo nun-
⁶⁶ tiat:

⁶⁶ Prospera Jupiter his dextris fulgo-
‘⁶ ribus edit.

⁶⁶ Ita nobis sinistra videntum Graiis
⁶⁶ et Barbaris dextra meliora. Quan-
⁶⁶ quam haud ignoro, quae bona
⁶⁶ sint, sinistra nos dicere: etiam si
⁶⁶ dextra sint. Sed certe nostri si-
⁶⁶ nistrum nominaverunt, externique
⁶⁶ dextrum, quia plerumque melius
⁶⁶ id videbatur.'' Thunder from the
left was, Ι believe, always account.
ed a good omen by the Romans.
Thus we havejust now seen that it
was so accounted by Ennius: and
virgil has mentioned Intonuit laevum
as a good omen in the second and in
the ninth AEneid. Pliny tells us,
that the East was accounted the lest
hand of heaven, which was dividet]
by the augurs into sixteen points3

that the eight eastern points wifrg
