158. Spectabit] It is exspectabis
in the Medicean manuscript, accord-
ing to Pierius. It is the same in the
Bodleian manuscript.

159. Concussa] lt is excussa in one
of Dr. Mcad's manuscripts.

160. Dicendum, de] Here the
Poct begins to describe the various
insti—unicum, with which a husband-
man ought to be provided.

16‘2. Robur] Robur is the name
of a particular sort of oak: but it is
used ¹‹tlso for any solid timber. Thus
we find it, in the twelsth AEncid,
applied to the wood of a wild olixo-
tree:

“ Forte sacer Fauni foliis oleaster
“ amaris

⁴¹ llic steterat. -———·

“ Viribus haud ullis valuit disclu-
¹⁴ dere morsus

⁴⁴ Roboris AEneaS.”

ln this place 1 take it to mean the
boam, or solid body of the plough.
163. Tardaque Eleusz'noe matris
volventia plaustra] This line beatt-
tifully describes the slow motion of
the cart. Ceres is called Eleusina

mater, from Eleusi-5, an Athenian
town, where Ceres was hospitably
received by Celeus, and in return,
taught his people the art of I‘lusban-
dry. The Eleusinians, in honour of
this goddess, instituted the Eleusinian
feasts, which were very famous. It
was death to disclose any os their
mysteries. Iu the feasts of Ceres at
Rome, her statue was carried about
in a cart or waggon.

164. Tribula.] The tribulum or
tribula was an instrument used by the
ancients to thresh their corn. lt was
a plank set with stones, or picces of
iron, with a weight laid upon it, and
so was drawn over the corn by oxon.
Varro has given us the description of
it: “ ld fit e tabula lapidibus, aut
‘⁴ ferro asperata, quo imposito auri·
“ ga, aut pondere grandi² trahitur
“ jutnentisjunctis, ut discutiat e spica
“ grana.” Tribulum is derived from
rfij, to tlzresh. Hence we may sce
why the first syllable of tribulum is
long3 but that ot tribulus short. I
mentioned, in the note on tribuli, ver.
153, that tribulus, the name of a
plant, and of an instrument used in
war. is so called from it's having τρεῖς
βολὰς, three spikes. Now the com-
pounds of τρεῖς have the first syllable
short3 as τρῖπες, of which we have
frequent instanees in Homer. 1 shall
