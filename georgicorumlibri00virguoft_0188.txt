nascuntur olima] There are many
soris. or varieffics, of olives: tho⁵1hey
aro not so numerous as apples, pears‚
ami pluinbs. Cato mentions eight
soi-ts3 oleam conclitlram, radium mcgjo-
rem, sallentinam, architem, possam,
serg-ianam, colminiamlm, albic-erem.
Columella says, that ten sorts only
had come to his knowledge: tho’ he
thinks there are more. The names
of the ten mentioned by Columella
are3 Paztsia, algiana, liciniano, ser-
gia, neria, culminia, orchis, regia, cir-
cites, murtea. He. mentions the ra-
dius also soon after3 but that may
probably bc only another name sor

one of ilic ton. 'shore are many
more sorts mentioned by Pliny, and
other authors3 the same sruit obtain-
ing, ‹is l suppose, different names, in
‹lini-rent provinces, and‘at different
timos. 'l'hus we n'nd in Pliny, that
the scrgicc was called regia by the Sa-
butus: and yet (folumella sets these
down as two differi-nt soris. Matthio-
lus informs us, that there were no
inore than three soris knuun in his
time in Tuscany: ‘⁶ Virgilius trium

scripts Ι have scen have orchades.
The sanie reading is in the Medi-
cean, and other ancient manuscript&
Heinsius also, La Corda, Ruaeus,
and most of the editors read orchades.
One of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts has
orchades, rudiique. making the mid*-
(ΗΕ syllable of orchades long. Ser·-
vius reads orchites, which I take to
be right, because 1 find it spelt in
that manner by the prose writers of
agriculture3 and particularly by Pli-
ny, when he quotes this very pas·
sage of virgil: ‘⁴ Genera earum
“tria dixit Virgilius, orchites, et
‘⁶ radios, et pausias.'⁷ The orchis is
a round olive, being so called from
ῧςχις, a testicle. Columella says that
it is fitter for eating‚ than to make

abounds most in oil: ‘⁶ Prima ergo
