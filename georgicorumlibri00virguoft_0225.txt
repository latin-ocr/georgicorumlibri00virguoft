“ being to be plowed‚ but by putting
“ weight upon the head of the beam.’'
1 believe ΜΓ. 13—— mistakes in trans-
lating rudis campuS, ‘rubble ground,-
sor rudis does not signify any particu-
lar sort of soil, but only that which
has not yet been cultivated. Thus
Columella: ‘· Sed nunc potius ube-
“ rioris soli meminerimus, cujus de-
“ monstranda est duplex ratim culti
‘⁴ et sylvestris: de sylvestri regione
“ in arvorum formam redigenda prius
“ dicemus—Incultum igitur locum
‘⁴ consideremus.—-Sed jam expedi-
“ enti rudis agri rationem sequitur
“ cultorum novalium cura.'' Here
sylvestris, incultus, and rudis are used
as synonymous ternis, to express a
field that has never been plowed for
corn: as rudis, applied to a person,
signifies one who has had no edu-
cati0n; whence erudire signifies to
instruct, or educate, that is to take
away. radonem, or rouglzness5 and
eruditus signifies a well eclucated, or
learned person, whose mind is not un-
cultivated. Enituit, which ΜΓ. 13—-
takes to mean the whitening of the
furrows, signifies to sleine, or look
beautiful. This verb, l think, is
used but once. more by our Poet‚ in
all his works. It is in the fourth
AEneid‚ where he describes AEneas
’ going forth to hunt with Dido, and
compares him to Apollo, for the
splendor of his dress, and beauty of
his person ε

“ -— Ipse ante alios pulcherrimus
“ omnes Ι ,

“ Infert se socium AEneas, atque ag-
“ minajungit.

“ Quam, ubi h) bernam Lycium,
‘² Xanthique lim-nm.

“ Deserit, ac Delum maternam in-
“ risit Apollo,

“ Instauratque choros, mixtique al-
“ tatia circum

“ Cretesque Dryopesque fremunt,
“ pictique Agathyrsi:

“ Ipse jugis Cynthi graditur, mol-
“ lique fluentem

“ que implicat auro:
