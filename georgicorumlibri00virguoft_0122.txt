NOTES.

Dryden seems to follow the other in-
terpretati0n :

“ The father os the gods his glory
“ shrowds,

‘⁶ Involv’d in tempests and anight
“ of clouds,

“ And from tho middle darkness
‘⁶ flashing out

‘⁶ By fits he dealshisfiergy bolis about.”

and ΜΓ. B—

“ Arnidst a night of· clouds his glit-
“ t‘rz'ngfire,

‘⁶ And rattling thunder hurls th’ eter· ί(

“ nal sire.''

&c.] So I venture to read it with
the Cambridge and one of the Arun-
delian manuscripts. The common
reading is fugere feroe, et mortalia
corda, ἀΰ. But tho making a pause
atseroe, and leaving out the conjunc-
tion, seems to me more poetical ε
Dr. Trapp justly observes thatfu.
ξένε being put in the preter-perfect
tense has a wonderful force: ‘⁵ We
“ see, says he, the beasts scmlding
‘⁵ cczcagy; and they are gorze, and out
(ζ ossigletin amoment.” Itis pity
‘that learned gentlemen did not pre-
serve the force of this tense in his
translation. He has not only used
the oresent tense, but bas diminished
the strength and quickncss of the
expression, which virgil has made to

consist only of two wordssugercse.
rte, by adding an epithet to boam,
and mentioning the place they fly to:

‘⁶ ——- S avagc heasts to cover-ts ssy.⁷'

Dryden has been guilty of the same
oversight :

‘⁶ And llying beasts in sorests seek
‘⁴ <modest

‘⁶ The Latin, says ΜΓ. Β is as
‘⁶ quick and sudden as their ssight.
‘4 Fugere ferae, they are all vanissh.
ed in an instant. But in Mr. Dry-
(ί den’s translation, one would ima..
‘⁶ gine these creatures were drove out
of some inclosed country,andwere γ
‘⁶ searching sor entertainment in the
⁴⁴ next forest.'' But ΜΓ. Β did
not observo the beauty of the tense. ·

 

 

‘⁶ Far shak cs the earth: beastsfly·

Cambridge, the Bodleian, one os the
Arundelian, and both Dr. Mcad's ma-
nuscripts have Athon, the other Arun-
delian manuscript has Aton. Pierius
observes that it is Athon in the Ro.
man, the Medicean, and some other
ancientmanuscripts. Servius, Hein-
sius, la Corda, Ruaeus, and most of
the good editors have Atho. It is
