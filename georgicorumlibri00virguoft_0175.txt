GEORG. LIB. ΙΙ.

Et turpes avibus praedam fert uva racemos. 60
Scilicet omnibus est labor impendendus, et

omnes

Cogendae in sulcum, ac multa mercede do-

mandae.

and the vine bears sorry clus-
ἴητε, a foed for birds. There-
{ore labour must be bestowed
on them all, and all must be
removed into trenches, and
tamed with much expence.
But olives succeed best by
uuncheons, vines by lay-ers.

NOTES.

Poet to speak of the fruit of the
imple-trec. Of the former opinion is
La Cei-da, who explains this passage
thus: ‘⁴ Praeterea poma harum ar-
‘⁶ borum facile degenerant, veluti
“ oblita suam naturam et succos.”
And Ruaeus, whose interpretation is
in these words: ‘⁶ Et fructus ejus
“ degenerant, amisso priore sapore.’‘
Dryden also translates this line in the
same sense:

‘⁶ The gen’rous flavour lost, the
“ fruits decay.''

And Dr. Trapp :

‘⁶ It’s fruit degen'rous
“ proves,
⁸⁶ Losing it's native juicew

 

Grimoaldus is of the latter opinion,
whose paraphrase runs thus: ‘⁶ Quem-
“ admodum pirus abit in pilastrum,
‘⁶ et mali dulces in amaras, aliaeque
“ in alias transeunt.'’ May's trans-
latinu also is in this sense ε

“ And apples lose the first goodjuice
‘⁶ they had.” -

And Mr. B ---’s:

⁶⁶ Degenerate apples thus forget their
tastess'

60. Turpes avibus proedam sert
uva racemos] Uva must be used here
figuratively for the tree: for uva sig-
nifies the whole clu-ster of grapa, as

well as racemus, not a single gyrwe,
which is properly called acinus or vi.
nuceum. Thus, at the latter end of
the fourth Georgick, we find uva
used to express n swarm of bees hang-
ing ou the branches of a tree:

‘⁵ Stridere apes utero, et ruptis effer-
‘⁶ vere costis-⁹

“ Immensasque trahi nubes3 jamque
‘⁶ arbore summa

‘⁶ Conssuere, et lentis uvam demit.
‘⁶ tere ramis.'’

63. Sed truncis, δὶα] Here the
Poet speaks of the several ways of
cultivating trees by human industry:
and gives us a no lessjust t'nan beau.
tiful description of the manner os
inoculating and ingrafting.

Servius, and after him most of the
other commentators, think that what
the Poet says here of olives is a repe-
tition of what he had said before:

“ Quin et caudicibus sectis, mirabile
‘⁶ dictu ἰ

fi(- Truditur e sicco radix oleagina
“ lign0.'’

In the note on that passage, it is
shewn, that Virgil speaks of a way
of cutting the trunk of an olive-trec
in pieces: and he mentions it as a
wonder, that the roots should shoot
from the (lry wood. Here he speaks
