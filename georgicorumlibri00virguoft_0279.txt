rich in various works3 nor
ease in large sarms, caves
and living lakes; nor of coo!
-vallies, and the lowiug ofoxen,
and sost sleep under trees.
There are lawns, and habita-
os wild beasts, and a
youth patient of laborm, and.
contented with a little, altars
of god5‚ and honoured parents:
justice lest the earth,
she took lier last step from
amongst these people.

NOTES.

But surely the Poet wrote at: sor he
is here opposing the real, innocent,
untainted pleasures of a country life
to the noise and luxury of courts and
cities.

Nescia fallere vitas] Pierius says
it is vitam in the Roman manuscript,
which must make nescia agree with
quies, but it is vita in all the rest,
which is better.

468. At.] It is acin the King‘s
manuscript. Pierius also found (ιε.

469. AL] Here again it is ae in
the Lombard manuscript, according
to Pierius. Ι find ac also in the King's
and both Dr. Mead’ s manuscripts:
but at seems to be much better m all

¹ these places.

Frigida Tempe] Tempe is the

l name of a very pleasant valley in

Thessaly. Hence it is not unusual to
find Tempe used hy the Poets for any
pleasant place tho’ not in Thessaly.

³ Thus I take it to be used· in this place

for cool vallies' in general. a
471. Illic. ] It· is illis‘ in the cam-
bridge manuscript, and in some
printed editions. Pierius says it is
illic· in all the ancient manuscripts he
had seen.
Saltus] Saltus properly signifies
iopen places in the midst of woods,

' which afford room sor cattle to seed,

Thus we have in the third Geor⁸¹
gick:

“ Saltibus in vacuis pascunt.”

Lustra ferarum] By the habita.
tions or dens of wild beasts the Poet

§leam the diversion of hunting. Thus
ay ε

‘² And pleasant huntings want not.”‚

472. Exigua] Pierius says it is
exiguo in the Roman manuscript:
Heinsius and Masvicius also read
exiguo. The common reading is
parvo,

473. Sam-tique patres] By these
words the Poet designs to express,
that amongst the uncorrupted coun-
trymen their fathers are treated with

reverence. Thus Mr. 13——

“ And aged sires rever’d.’'

I have chosen to make use of the
word honoured, because‚· in our reli-
gion, this duty to parents is stiled

honour.
Extrema per illos J ustztza excedens

terris vestigia fecit] In the ,Cam-
bridge manuscript it is figit.
