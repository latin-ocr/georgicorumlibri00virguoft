NOTES.

either sex ε the Drones are discover-
ed to have the male organs of gene-
rati0n3 and the King is found to be
of the female sex. This King, or
rather Quaen, is wholly employed
in the increase of the family, lay-ing
several thousand eggs every summer,
from each of which is hatched a small
white worm, which in due time
changes either to a Bee or a Drone.
The KingS, the labouring Bees, and
the Drones, are all promiscuously
hatched from these cggs: and the
same order of nature has lately been
observed in the YVasps.

198. Concubitu] Concubitu is
used sor concubitui, as before victu
for victui.

Δ200. Verum ipsae e foliis natos]
So l read with Heinsius, all the ma-
nuscripts that I have collated, and
most of the editors. In several of
the oldest editions it is verum ipsae,
vzcttosfolz'is. Paul Stephens andSchre-
velius read *cerum ipsae foliis mltos
without e, which reading Pierius also
admitted3 who observes, thatin some
manuscripts it is ipsa? natos foliis;
and ipsae efoliis in the Roman copy,
which he thinks an elegant reading.
La Cerda reads ipsoe foliis natos.

Bysolz‘z's perhaps the Poet means
the petals or leaves of fiowers3 for
Aristotlc speaks wholly of flowers.

202. Rcfingzmt] Servius and Pie-
rius read refigunt, but this last com-
mentator thinks refingant better, as
he found it in the Roman, the Me-
dicean, and in some other of the
older manuscripts. It is rcy‘igzmt in
the Cambridge, the Bodleian, one
of the Arundclian, and one of Dr.
Mead's manuscripts, which reading
is admitted by most of the oldest edi-
tors, and by Grimoaldus, Paul Ste-
phcns, La Cerda, Schrevelius, and
others. But Heinsius, Ruaeus, Mas-
ricius, and most of the later edi-
tions have refingunt.

203. Soepe etiam duris, δῖα]
These three lines seem to be mis-
placed: sor here they interrupt the
sense. They seem to come in more
properly after ver. 196. I am in.
debted for this observation to the
learned Sir Daniel Molyneux, Baron-
et, F. R. S.

206. Angusta] Some read an.
gustas ; but Pierius found angusti in

all the manuscripts that he could
procure-
