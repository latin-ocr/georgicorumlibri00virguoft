says, the charioteers stood upon their
scats. Had Mr. Pope favoured us
with a translation of this passage of
Virgil, I believe every impartial
reader would have given the prefer.
ence to the Latin Poet. But as we
cannot shew Virgil in the English
language with equal advantage3 I
shall represent the passage in Homer,
under the same disadvantages of a
literal translation: ‘⁶ They all at

‘⁶ horses, and lashed them with their

‘⁴ them with words. They run
‘⁶ swiftly over the plain, and are
‘⁶ soon distant from the ships. The
‘⁶ scattered dust rises under their
‘⁶ breasts, like a cloud or slorm, and
“their manes float n'aving in the

easily observo how much more ani-

that of Homer. The chariots (lo

113. Ericthonius.] The first in.
ventors of things are very doubtfully
delivered down to us hythe AncientS.
Cicero, in his third book de Natura
Deorum, ascribes the invention of the
quadrigae to the fourth Minerva:
‘⁶ Minerva prima quam Apollinis
‘⁶ matrem supra diximus: secunda
⁴² orta Nilo, quam AEgyptii Saitae
‘4 colunt: tertia illa quam Jove ge.
‘⁴ neratam supra diximus: quarta
‘⁵ Jove nata et Coryphe, Oceani filia,
‘⁶ qnam Arcades Coriam nominant,
“ et quadrigarum inventricem ferunt.’²
Ericthonius however is generally al-
lou-ed to have been the inventor of cha-
riots, to hide the deformity of his feet.
The commentator-s tell a ridiculous
story of his being produced by a vain
endeavour of Vulcan to enjoy Minerva,
who resisted his attempts: and derive
his name from ἔρις strffe, and χθὼν
the earth. Thr-y make him the
fourth king of the Athenians. But
Sir Isaac Newton suspects this Eric...
thonius to be no other than Erectheus,
and to he salsly added as a different
king of Athens, to lengthen their
chronology. l rather believe the
Ericthonius here meant is the son
of Dardanus and father of Tr0s;
because Pliny mentions him with
the Phrygiam, to whom he ascribes
the invention of putting two horses
