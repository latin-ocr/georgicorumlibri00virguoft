NOTES.

pliention only one, in the twenty-third
iad :

Te? μὲν νικήσαντι μέγαν τρίποδ’ ἐμπυρι-
Cin-m.

But the first syllable of τρῖζω is long;
of which we have an instance a few
lines aster, in the same lliad:

Mmte'r' ἐρείδεσθον, μηδὲ τρῖςεσὲε κακοῖσι.

Τ rehem] The trahea or traha is
a carriage without wheels. It was
used to beat out the corn, as well as
the tribulum. This appears from Co-
lumella: “ At si competit, ut in area
“ teratur frumentum, nihil dubium
“ est, quin equis melius, quarn bubus
“ ea res conficiatur, ct si paucajuga
‘⁶ sunt, adjicere tribulam et traham
“ possis‚¹ quae res utraque culmos fa-
“ cillime comminuit.''

Iniquo pondere rastri] See the note
on ver. 95. '

165. Celei] Celeus was the fa-
ther of Triptolemus, whom Ceres in-
structed in husbandry.

is an instrument used to cleanse tho
corn: thus Columella3 ‘⁶ Ipsae au·
“ tem spicae melius fustibus tundun-
“ tnr, vannisque expurgantur.’' It is
called mystica, because it was used in
the mysteries of Bacchus. Iacchus
was a name of Bacchus seldom made
use of, but 011 solemn and sacred oc-
casions.

]69, Continuo z‘n sylvis dvc] Here
the Poet gives us a description of the
plough, in which we find that the
custom was to bend an elui, as it
grew, into the crooked form of the
buris, or plough-teil, to which the
bearn, the carth-boards‚ and the
share-boam were fastened.

171. Temo] This is the bearn, or
pole, which ‘goes between the oxen‚
and to which they are yoked. Hesiod
calls ὶῑῖς-οζοεὺς, which is derived from
ῖς-ὸς, α mast, and Βοὲς, an ox. He says
it is made either of bay or elm :

Δάφνης δ’ ἢ fenim ἁκεῶταΊοι ἶς’·οςοῆες.

172. Aures] These must be the
earth-boards‚ which being placed on
each side of the share-beam, serve to
make the furrows wider, and the
ridges higher. Palladius tells us that
