300. Frondentia subulca] in the
first hook, Xfirgil uses ανῦιιὶιιηι for
the fruit, and in the second, mbutus
for the treet but here arbatum is
used sor the tree. The epithet
fronslenlt'a is a plain proof, that in
this place he means the tree, which
is au ever-green, and therefore sup..
plies the goats with browze in win-
ter, of which season Virgil is now
speaking. Columella mentions the
arbutus among those shrubs which
are covetcd by goats: ‘⁶ Id autom
‘⁶ genus dumeta potius, quam cam-
‘⁶ pestre situm (lesiderat:'asperisque

“quiin altitudinem non prosiliunt.’'
303. Cum frigidus olim jam ca-
(lit, δια] In one of the Arundelian
manuscripts it is dum instead of cum.
In this place, as Ruaeus well ob.
serves, 'Virgil must mean that year,
which began with March, for Aqua-
rius was reckoned to rise about the
middle os January, and to set about

the middle os February. Aquarius
is represented pouring water out of
an urn, and was esteemed a rainy
sign.

reads hoec. ...tuenda, and says the
Poet uses the neuter gender figura-
tively. Iu this he is followed by
several of the oldest editors. But
Heinsius, and almost all the late
editors read Jzae....tuendoe‚ which
reading Ι find also in all the manu-
scripts, which Ι have collated. In
one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts, it is'
necinsteadof Izoe.

306, Nec minor usus erit] Goats
are of no less value than sheep: sor
they are very sruitful, and yield
abuudance of milk, which is very
little, if at all inferior to that of the
ass, in nourishing weak, and restoring
wasting bodies. They are kept with
very little expence, for they will
seed ou briars, and almost any wild
shrubs. The kids are very good
meat· they climb the steepest rocks
and precipices. tho’ their feet do not>
at all seem to be made sor that pur.
ose.
