The colokur which Plutarch means in
this passage seems to be a blueish grey.
Aulus Gellius seems to consound green
and blue together, sor he says that
when virgil mentioned the green co-
lour osa horse, he might as well have
expressed it by the Latin word caeru-
leus, as by the Greek word glaucus.
ξ( Sed ne viridis quidem color pluri-
‘⁶ bus ab illis, quam a nobis, voca-
‘⁶ bulis dicitur. Neque non potuit
μ Virgilins colorem equi significare
ἔ( viridem volens, caeruleum magis
‚66 dicere equum quam glaucum : sed
‘⁶ maluit verbo uti notiore Graeco,
ἶ( quam inusitato Latino. Nostris
“⁶ autem Latinis veteribus etesia dicta
‘⁶ est quae a Graecis γλαυκῶπις, ut
ι( Nigidius ait de colore caeli qnasi
ξ( caelia.’' From all these quota..
tions I think it appearS, that the
·;1ncients meant by glaucus a colour
which had a saint green or blue cast.
Now as no horse can be properly
said to be either bine or green, we
may conclude that the colour meant
by virgil is a fine gwy, which has a
lilueish cast. But I do not see how
Buaeus could gather from Aulus Gel-
lius² whose words Ι have related at

length, that this grey was dappied(
lt must however be allowed that the
dappled grey is the most beautiful.

Albis] S. Isidore informs us that
albus and candidus are very different:
candidus signifying a bright whiteness‚
like snow: and albus a pale or dirty
white: ‘4 Candidus autem et albus in-
‘² vicem sibi differunt. Nam albus
‘⁴ cum quodam pallore est, candidus
‘⁶ vero, niveus et pura luce perfusuS.'’
I am not persectly satisfied with this
distinction: for Virgil himself fre-
quently uses albus exactly in the same¹
sense as he uses candidus. In the se-
cond Georgick he uses it sor the white-
ness of the finest wool:

ζ( Alba neque Assyrio fuscaturlana
‘⁶ veneno.”

And again in the same Georgick:
‘⁴ Hinc albi, Clitumne, gregeS.”

And in the third Georgick:

‘⁴ Continuoque greges villis lege mol-2⁴¹
‘⁶ libus albos.’'

And in the third AEneid:

‘⁶ Nigram-hyemipecudem7 Zephyris
‘⁶ felicibus albam.’‘ ¹ '

In the seventh AEneid it is used sor
the whiteness of the teeth of a lion ε

‘⁴ Ille pedes tegmen torquens immane
