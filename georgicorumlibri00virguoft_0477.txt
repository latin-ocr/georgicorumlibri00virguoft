the dusky redncss of the 31111, after
the murder of Julius Caesar:

111 1110 sixth AEneid the boat of Cha-
ron is called ferruginea, where no
doubt it means duslcy:

’ “ Et ferruginea subvectat corpora

In the ninth tEneid the son os Ar-
cens is said to be

Ferrugine clarus Ibera 3³⁷

That is, adorned with a deep purple
garmcnt dyed in Spain: and in the
eleventh book it is joined with the
Tyrian colour:

‘⁶ Ipse peregrina ferrugine clarus et
‘⁶ ostro.⁷’

It is probable that all these several
epithets, purpureus, suave rubens,
¹ ferruginem, mean a sort of 0111113011,
1110 0010111 of human blood, the Hya-
cinth being seigned to have risen from
the blood of Hyacinthus, and after-
wards from that of A‘jax.

Having said thus much of the Hya..
cinth of the Poets, it will be 111110 10
consider what flower will agree with

the description which they have given
of it.·

Various sorts offlowers have been
proposed, by the Botanical Critics,
for this Hyacinth, the diseussing of
all which would be too tedious in this
place. Some insist on the Lark’s-
spur, which does not seem to me to
bear any resemblance ofa Lily, nor
do the letters inscribed appear, till
the flower has been curiously dis..
sected. Others propose the red Lily,
but this, as was observed before, was
a flower little known among the An-
cients, nor is the colour right. Others
mention Xyrz’S, or stinlcz'ng Glctclclon,
the fiowers of which are not suffi-
ciently beautiful. Others, with more
probability, think 1110 Gladiolas or
Corn-flag to be the flower in ques-
tion3 but I have never been able to
discover 111 that ‘ssower the letters

the ssower celebrated by the Poets,

under the name of Lilium floribus
reflexi-c, or Martagon, and perhaps
may be that very species which we
call Imperial Dlartagon. The flowers
of most sorts of Martagons have
many spots of a deepcr colour3 and
sometimes I have seen these spots
run together in such 3 manner, as to
form the letters A Ι, 111 several places,
which I have caused to be repre.

The Translators have grievously
