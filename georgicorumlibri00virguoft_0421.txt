He comes now to relate particular
instances of the dire effects of this
pestilence. The victims dropped
down dead suddenly before the altars:
or if they lived to bear the knife of
the sacrificer, their flesh would not
burn; nor could the augures divine
‘any thing from the inspection of their
entrails. He then mentions the ef.
fects of this disease on calve5‚ dogs‚
and swine.

Thucydides says that prayer-s to the
gods aud inquiries at the oracles were
os no service, and at last were laid
aside: ‘'Ow. τε πρὸς ἱεροῖς ἱκέτευσαν, ³),

487. Lama] Pierius reads Ze'neass
but he says it is laneain the Medicean‚
the Lombard‚ and in some other an-
cient manuscripts. I find laurea in
some of the old edition53 but lanea
is generally received.

τελευτῶντές τε

Insula] The Insula was a sort of
diadem or fillet, with which the heads
of the victims were bound. Ruaeus
says the vittae were the ornaments
which hung down from the Insula.

Sacerdos] Dry-den has grossly
translated this word hely butcher.

491. Nec responsa polest consultus

victims were thought netto discover
the will of the gods⁷ unless they were
sound.

both the Arundelian, one of Dr.
Mead’s manuscripts, and in several
of the oldest editions. In some of

wasted, and, instead of blood, there
came out only a corrupted matter.
