GEORG. Liss. IV.

Ferre domum prohibent, neque oves hcedique petulci
Floribus insultent, aut errans bucula campo
Decutiat rorem, et surgentes atterat herbas.
Absint et picti squalentia terga lacerti

Pinguibus a stabulis, meropesque, aliaeque volucres,
Et manibus Procne pectus signata cruentis.

Statim] In this word the Poet
alludes to military discipline, which
figure he almost constantly preserve&
Pliny pursues this metaphor saying

13. Picti squalentia Ierga luceru]
Lizards are scaly four-footed ani-
mals, with long tails. There are
m'any sorts of them, one of which
is the most celebrated under the
name of Crocodile or Alligator. 'rho
green lizard is the most common in
Italy: that which we have in Eng-
land is smaller, and of various co-
lours: it is commonly called an Est
or Newt. We have also a water
Est, which is frequently seen in stand-
ing waters.

14. ssleropesquc.] Pierius found
meropes without que in the Mediecan
manuscript: it is the same in oue
of Dr. Mead's copies.

The Illerops, Apt'asler, or Rec-
eater, is shapcd like a King-fisher.
lt is about the sizo [of a Blackbird.
Its feet are exactly like those of the
Kingfisher, as is also its bill, only
it bends a. little more downward.

The top of the head is reddish3 the
neck and shoulders green, with a
mixture of red. It is yellow under
the chin, and its breast and belly are
blue. It seeds on ssees and other in-
sects. It is found in Italy, but has
been observed to be most frequent
in the island of Car-dy or ancient?
Crete. It builds in caverns‚ and is
a bird of passage. May translates
meropes woocl-peclcers ; Addison
tenocl-peclcs ,· Dryden the tilmozcse
crufthe pet-leer‘s Izzcngry brood,· and
Dr. Trapp the zcood-pecker. Bee-
ealea- would not have sonnded very
elegautly in verse, but they might have
preserved the original word merops.
110 wever, it is certainly wrong to call
it by the name of another well known
bird, to which it does net bear any
resemblance.

1 5. Manibus Procnepectus signata
emonam] It is Progne in the King’s,
both the Aruudelian, one of Dr.
Meazi's manuscripts, andin several
of the printed editions. But the
most correct reading seems to be
Procne, as it is in the Roman, and
others· of the most ancient manu-
scriptS, according to Pierius. The
same author found Procne also in
some ancient inscriptions at Rome.

Procne and Philomela, according
to the suble, were the daughters of

Pandion,
