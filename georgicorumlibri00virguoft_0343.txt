³ five. Thus Servius interprets this
passage: ‘⁴ Ordo talis est, circa lucos
“ Silariflecme'nis Luc-(mise, et Albzcr.
‘⁴ num (jus montem est plurimus voli.
‘⁶ tans: ac si diceret, est malla musca.
‘⁶ Volitans autem modo nomen est,
‘⁶ non partieipium.”

147. Alburnum] Alburnus was
the name of a mountain near the river
Silarus.

Cnmon'zen chila] Asilo is here
put in the dative case, after the man..
ner of the Greeks, Thus we [ind
in the fourth Georgick:

And in the first :Eneidz

‘² At puer Ascanius‚‹:zci11unc cogno.

And in the ninth:

in the King’s‚ in one of the Arunda,

OEslron Graii verlere vocantem]
Seri-ius understands these words to
mean, that the Greeks caum] this

insect οἶσἺρος, from it’s whizzing
noise: for he thinks it cannot be
the Poet‘s meaning, that the Greeks
translated it from the Latin, because
the Greek is the more ancient lan.
guage: ‘² Vertere ex soni similitm,
“ dine, onomatopoieam secere. Non
‘⁶ enirn possumus accipere, ex Latina.
‘⁶ lingua mutavere, cum constet
‘² Graecam primam fuisse.” It is
probable however, that this insect
might have been first taken notice of
by the ancient inhabitants of Italy.
For that country was anciently cele-
brated for the finest kine: and Ti-
niaeuS, as he is quoted by Vane, in-
forms us, that the ancient Greeks
called bulis ἰταλούς, and thence call.
ed the country Italy, because it
abounded with the finest bulls and
caives: ‘⁶ Vide quid agas, inquam,
“ Vacci. Nam bos in pecuaria,
‘⁶ maxima debet esse auctoritate:
“ praesertim in Italia, quae a bubus
‘⁶ nomen habere sit existimata. Grae-
‘⁶ cia enim antiqua, ut scribit Ti.
“ maeus, tauros vocabant ῖταλούς, a
‘⁶ quorum multitudine, et pulchritu-
“ dine, et foetu vitulorum Italiam dix.
‘⁶ erunt.” To this we may add, that
Seneca understood the Poet to mean,
that Asilas was the ancient name, but
that the Greek name oestrus or ωε-
trum was then received instead of it:
‘⁴ Hunc quem Graeci oestrum vo.
‘⁶ cant, pecora peragentem, et totis
‘⁴ saltibus dissipantem, asilum nostri
‘⁶ vocabant. Hoc Virgilio licet
“ credas:
