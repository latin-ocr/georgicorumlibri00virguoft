viii THE PREFACE.

to the most judicious of all Poets‚ in the most vigorous part
of his life. Besides, it appears that he was continually re-
vising it to the very day of his death.

It would be an endless labour to point out all the several
beauties 111 this Poeni: but it would be an unpardonable
omission in an Editor, to pass them wholly over in silence.
The reader will easily observe the variety which virgil uses

spirit of Poetry, would have contented himself with dryly
telling us, that it is proper to break the clods with harrows,
and by drawing hurdles over them; and to plough the fur-
rows across 3 that moist summers and fair winters are to be
desired3 and that it is good to ssoat the field after it is
sown. These precepts are just3 but it is the part of a Poet

bandman, who breaks the clods with harrows and hurdles,
greatly helps the fields; and then he introduces Ceres look-
ing down from heaven with a favourable aspect upon him,
and on those also, who plow the field across, which he beau-
tifully calls exercising the earth, and commanding the fieldsss.
He expresses the advantage of moist summers and dry
winters, by advising the farmers to pray for such seasons;
and then immediately leaves the didactic style, and repre-
sents the fields as rejoicing in winter (lust, and introduces
