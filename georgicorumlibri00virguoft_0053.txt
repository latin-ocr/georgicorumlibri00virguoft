GEORG. LIB. I. ‘27

Atque levem stipulam crepitantibus urere flammis:
Sive inde occultas vires, et pabula terrae
Pinguia concipiunt: sive illis omne per ignem
Excoquitur vitium, atque exudat inutilis humor:
Seu plures calor ille vias, et caeca relaxat
Spiramenta, novas veniat qua succus in herbas. 90

Seu durat magis, et venas adstringit hiantes3

“ tilia concremare.'’ G rinwaldus also

interpr-ets this passage3 ‘⁵ Saepenu- join ωερε to incendere.

“ mero etiam herbas, frutices, ct
“ stipulam igne absumpsisse, ad repa-
“ randam sterilium agrorum foecun-
‘⁶ dit-atem nonnihil consert.’' Dryden
also translates it in this sense:

‘⁶' Long practice has a sure improve-
“ ment found,

“ With kindled fires to burn the bar-
“ ren groun‹l;

“ When the light stubble to the
‘⁵ flames resign'd‚

“ Is driv’n along, and crackles in the
‘⁶ wind.’'

And Dr. Trapp :

“ Oft too it has been gainful found
‘⁶ to burn

“ The barren fields with stubble's
“ crackling flame.''

He sayS, “ agros atque stipulam flam-
“ mis: i. e. agros flammis stipulae!²
Mr. B differs from them all, and
says, “ Virgil speaks of two different
“ things, of burning the soil itself
“ before the ground is· plowed, and
“ of burining the stubble after the
“ corn is taken off from arablc land.''
This seems to be the most natural
interpretation.

Scepa] Servius tells us that some
If this inter-
pretation be admitted, we must ren-
der this passage3 ‘⁴ lt is beneficial
‘⁶ also to set fire often to the barren
“ fields.''

85. Atque lez-em stipulam crepitan-
tibus were flammis] It is scarce
possible to avoid observing how beau-
tifully the rapidity of this verse, con-
sisting entirely of Dactyls, expresses
the swiftness of the flame, spreading
over a stubbio field. vida quotes this
passage, amongst the many beautiful
examples of making the sound an
echo to the sense:

‘⁴ Hinc etiam solers mirabere saepe
‘⁶ legendo

“ Sicubi Vulcanus sylvis incendia
‘⁶ misit,

‘⁴ Aut agro stipulas flamma crepi-
“ tante cremari.”

86. Pabula] The Commentators ⁷

, generally suppose, that when the Poet

speaks of this nourishment to be de-
rived from the firi», he alludes to the
philosophy of Heraclitus3 that all
things are created out of fire. La.
Cerda, with better reason, thinks,
that he means the nourishment pro-
coeding from the ashes.
