NOTES. ’

the tenth of June, according to both
Columella and Pliny: ‘⁶ Quarto I..
(ί dus Delphinus vespere exoritur.”
Therefore the 'time allotted by Varro
is from the tenth os June to about
the twentieth of July. The barley
, harvest was reckoned to begin about

the latter end of June, or the begin- ⁴

ning of July. Thus the cows might
be employed in treading out the
barley, before the bull was admit-
ted to them. Columella expressly
mentions July as the proper time:
“ Mense Julio foeminae maribus ple-
“ rumque permittendae, ut eo tempore
‘4 conceptos proximo vere adultis jam
ὅ( pabulis edant. Nam decem mensi-
‘⁶ bus ventrem perferu11t‚” Palladius
also assigns the mouth of July as the
proper season: “ Hoc tempore maxime
‘⁴ tauris submittendae sunt vaccae, quia
‘⁴ decc-m mensium partus sic poterit
‘⁶ maturovereconcludi.'’ But thetime
for covering mares is much earlier, aud
hry no means agrees with the time of
harvest. According to Varr0‚ it is
from the verna] equinox to the, sol-
nice, that is, from the twenty-fourth
or twenty-fifth of their March to
the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of
June:
“ missionis facere oportet, ab aequi.
‘⁶ noetio verno ad solstitium, ut par.
‘⁶ tus idoneo tempore fiat. Duode-
“ cimo enim mense, die decimo
“ aiunt nasci.” According to Co.
lumella, the time Vis about the ver.
:nal equinox: ‘⁶ Generosis circa ver-

⁶⁶ Horum soeturae initium ad. ⁷

‘⁶ num aequinectium mares juugeffi
‘⁶ tur, ut eodem tempore, quo con-
‘² ceperint, jam laetis et herbidis
‘⁴ campis post anni messem parvo
‘⁶ cum labore foetum educent. Nam
‘⁶ meuse duodecimo partum edunt.’'
Palladius sets down March *as the
seuseu: “Hoc mense saginati, ac
‘⁶ pasti auteadmissarii generosis equa.
‘⁵ bus admittendi sunt.’' γ

lines the modesty of the Poet is very
remarkable. His expressionsare glow-
ing and poetical3 and at the same
time not ofl'onsive to the chastest ear.
Some of his commentators however
have been careful to explain in the
clearest manner what their author
took care to veil decently with figures·
Dryden's translation is abominably
obscene, for which he has been justi?

thro‘ sear of offentiing in the same
manner, has comprised these three
