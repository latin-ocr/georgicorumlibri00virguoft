should! mention the baisam,
which sweass out οἱ the fra-

the ever-green acanthus ξ

NOTES.

Dioscorides mentions an Indian Ebo-
ny, but he says the best comes from
Ethiopia: ''I-:Ceuoq agario-‘tn ἦ &Quom-2.
ἔστι δὲ ‘rig aa} ἴνὸικῆ. Lucan IS
quoted sor saying it is an Egyptian
plant:

 

‘G

 

Ebenus Mareotica vastos

‘⁶ Non operit posteS‚ sed stat pro ro·
“ bore vili

“ Auxilium.''

Butit has, not without reason, been
supposed, that we ought to read ssIe-
roatica instead of Mareotica, which
will make the Ebony, not an Egyp-
tian, but an Ethiopian plant, even
according to Lucan, for Mero'e is in
Ethiopia. This emendation is con-
firmed by another passage in the same
author ; where he expressly says that
the Ebon)⁷ grows in Meroe ;

C‘

 

Late tibi gurgite rupto

‘⁴ Ambitur nigris Meroe foecunda co·
“ lonis,

“ Laeta comis Ebeni: quae, quam·
“ vis arbore multa

‘⁴ Frondeat, aestatem nulla sibimiti- '

“ gat umbra.’'

Thus we find a concurrent testimony
of several authors, that the Ebony
grows in Ethiopia, whereas virgil
asserts, that it grows only in India.
,- Servius vindicates the Poet by saying‚

ᾗ ’. that Ethiopia was reckoned a part of

cum auro et ebore, proden‹lo.”

India 3 which opinion seems to be
confirmed by a passage in the fourth
Georgick, where the source of the
Nile is said to be India3 which must
be understood to mean Ethiopia‚ for
it is impossible to suppose the Nile to
rise in India properly so called :

“ Et diversa ruens septem discurrit
‘⁶ in ora

“ Usque coloratis amnis devexus ab
“ Indis.'’

However it is not improbable, that
the Poet might think that Ebony was
peculiar to India, for we find that
Theophrastus was of the same opi—
nion. This great author speaking ot*
the trees of India, says that Ebony is
peculiar to that country: ἴδιοι δὲ καῖ
ἑξέτη τῆς χῶξας ταύτης.

See the note on molles saa thura Sa-
baei, Book 1. ver. 57.

119. Balsamaque] In one of Dr.
Mead's manuscripts, it is Balsama,
quid. If this reading, which seems
very good, be admitted, the whole
passage will stand thus:

“ Quid tibi odorato referam sudantia
“ ligno

“ Balsama? quid baccas semper fron·
‘⁴ dentis acanthi ἲ

“ Quid nemora AEthiopum molli
“ canentia lana?

In the Cambridge manuscript, it is
Balsama, et baccas.
