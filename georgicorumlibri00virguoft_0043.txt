NOTES.

affirm that it is found only in Ara-
bia. Dioscorides mentions au Indiam
as well as an 'Arabiam frankincense.
Garcias affirms that it does not grow
in any part of India, and that the
Indians· have all their frankincense
from Arabia. Bodaeus a stapel, 'm
his notes on Theophrastus, observes
that the Greek writers called that
sort of frankincense Indiam, which
grew in the islands near Arabia, be-
cause those islands were formerly un-
der the government of the Indians.
Virgil gives them the epithet of

molles because of their effeminacy3
thus Manilius ε

“ Nec procul in molles Arabes, ter-
“ ramque ferentem
“ Delicias-'²

And again,

“ Et molles Arabes, sylvarum ditia
“ rcgna.’

58. Chalybes nudi ferrum] There
is some doubt who these Chalybes
are. Strabo says the Chaldoans were
ancient!y so called, and that their
chief support is from xron and otlur
metals: Τῆς δε ΤραπεζοῢνἹος ὑπε ρκεινἾαι,
και της Φαρνακιας, Τοςαρηνοῖ τε ναι Χαλ-
Safon. Os δὲ νῦν Χοιλὲαῖοι7 Χάλυςες

Justin makes them a pcople of Spain,
and says they take their name from
the rivcr Chalybs, near which they
dwcll. Both Dryden and Mr. 13-
have followed Justin, translathng
Chalybes Spaniards, They are call-
ed naked, because the excessivo beat
of their forges made them work
naked. Thus we find one of the
Cyclops described, when at work z

Viros-aque Pontus Castorem] Pon-

enchantments. virgil mentions them
in his ‹·ighth cclogue:
