NOTES.

serves, must have been added by
virgil, aster he had finished the
Georgicks: for it was about the time
of his concluding this work, that
Augustus went into Asia, and spent
tlie winter near the Euphrath after
he had vanquished Anthony and
Cleopatra.

17 2. Imhellem avertis Romanis ar-
cibus Indum] Some think the ludians
here mentioned are the Ethiopians,
who came to the assistance of Cleo-

patra, and are called Indians in the
eighth AEneid.

“ ——Omnis eo terrore AEgyptus,
“ et Indi,

“ Omnis Arabs, omnes vertebant

Others think he alludes to the In-
dians, who being moved by the great
fame of the valour and moderatiori
of Augustus sent ambassadors to him

to desire his friendship; as we find μ

in Suetonius: “ Qua virtutis mode-
“ rationisque fama, Indos etiam ae
“ Scythas, auditu modo cognitos,
‘⁴ pellexit ad amicitiam suam popu-
‘⁶ lique Romani ultro per legatos pe-
“ tendam.” We find also in Florus,
that after Augustus had subdued the
people between ihe Euphrates and
mount Taurus, those nations also
who had not been subdued by arms,

amongst whom he reckons the In-
diam, came to him of their own ac-
cord, bringing him presents, and de-
siring his friendship: “ Omnibus
‘⁶ ad occasum, et meridiem pacatis
“ gentibus, ad septentrionem quoque
‘⁴ duntaxat intra Rhenum atque Da—
“ nubium3 item ad orientem intra
“ Taurum et Euphratem, illi quoque
“ reliqui, qui immunes imperii erant,
“ sentiebant tamen magnitudinem, et
“ victorem gentium Populum Ro-
“ manum reverebantur. Nam et
‘¹ Scythae misere legatos, et Sarmatae
“ amicitiam petentes. Seres etiam
“ habitantesque sub ipso sole Indi,
“ cum gemmis et margaritis, Ele-
“ phantes quoque inter munera tra-
“ hentes, nihil magis quam longin-
“ quitatem viae imputabant, quam
“ quadriennio impleverant: et ta-
“ men ipse hominum color ab alio
“ venire caelo fatebatur.’' These
“things happened in the year of
Rome 7 24, about the time that Vir-
gil finished his Georgicks, as he him-
self testifies at the end of the fourth
book:

‘⁴ Haec super arvorum cultu, peco-
“ rumque canebam,

‘⁶ Et super arboribus: Caesar dum
“ magnus ad altum

“ Fulminat Euphratem belle, victor·
‘⁶ que volentes

‘⁶ Per populos dat jura, viamque af-
“ fectat olympo.”

From what has been said, we may
observe that imbellem in this place is
not' to be rendered wealc, effeminate,
