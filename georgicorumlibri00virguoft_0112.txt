Many things also may be done
better in the cool night, or
when the morning bedews the
earth at sun-rising. By night
the light stubble, by night 1110
parched meadows are better
cut : the clanimy dew is never
known to fail in the night.

NOTES.

e87. Multa adeo, So] The Poet
proceeds to mention what sort of
works arcto be done in 1110 night,
both in winter and summer.

Gelicla melina] Thus it is in the
Medieean and other ancient manu-
scripts, according to Pierius : and in
all the manuscripts, which I have
collated, except one of Dr. Mead's.
Heinsius, La Cerda, Ruaeus‚ and most
of the editors have gelida melius. In
some few editions it is melius gelida.

⁶288. Arm] Pierius says it is vel
in some ancient manuscripts: but that
most copies have aut. One of Dr.
Mcad's manuscripts also has vel.

broma] In one of the Arunde-
lian manuscripts it is irrigat.

Eous] Servius, and most of the
conimentators interpret this the Blorn-
ing Star. Some take it to mean one
of 1110 1101505 of the sun of that name.
He is mentioned by Ovid:

‘⁶ Interea volucres PyroeiS‚ et Eous,
‘⁴ et A‘Ethomr
‘⁶ Solis equi, quartusque Phlegon.”

ί289. Nocte leves melius stipulae]
Heinsius 15 almost singular, in print-
ing 1110 words in this order. Pierius
however observes that the same dis-

position is in all the ancient manu-o
scripts which 110 had 50011 : and that
it is more elegant than the common
reading.

Nocte arida prata tondentur]
Pliny also observes that a dewy night
is 1111051 sor mowing: <a Noctibus
‘⁶ roscidis secari inelius.”

290¹. Noctes] In some manuscripts
it is noctis : which may be either the
genitive case singular, or the accusa-
tive plural. Pierius proves it is the
accusative plural, from a passage in
Arusianus Messus7 (le Elocutz’onz'bus
Virgilii: where, observing 111111ιίςῇ-
cit illam rem is an elegant expression,
he quotes the authority of virgil,
who wrote Noctes lentas non deficit
lzzcmor. ⁷

5392. Faces inspicat] The torches
of the Ancients were sticks cut to a
101111.

l 295. Dulcismuste· Vulcano decoquit
humorem] Must is the new wine
before it is fermented. We find in
Columella‚ that it was usual to boi!
some of 1110 must till a fourth part, or
athird, or even sometimes half was
evaporated. This Vir-gil expresses
by decoquit humorem. The nse of
this boiled must is to put into some

sorts of wine to make them keep. Colli}-
