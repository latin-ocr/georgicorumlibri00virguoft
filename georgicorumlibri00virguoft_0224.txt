According to 1110 common interpre-
tation of stirpibus imis, virgil is not
mado guilty of tautology: sor nemora
evertit does not necessarily signify
grubbcd up tlte grows, but may bc in-
terp¹·‹·tcdfi¹llc(l the grorcs. [ἴτω-1010
15 rendered [osell‚ in the first Geor-
gick, by Mr. Β- himself:

“ Aut tempestivam sylvis evertere pi-
“ num ;’'

which 110 thus translatcs3

“ And timely on 1110 mountain fell
“ the fir.’'

'l’hcrefore the Poct has not expressly
said that 1110 groves are grubbcd up,
1111 110 mentions cum stirpibus imis.
Altum, I believe, is never used sor
1110 top of a trec, especially after it
has been fcllcd.

Manilius’s description of the felling
of 110011515 1101 very unlike that of
our Poct:

‘⁶ -—- Ruit ccco nemus, saltusque
“ vetusti

‘⁶ Procumbunt, solemque. novum,
“ nova sidera cernunt.

‘⁶ Pellitur 01111101οω volucrum genus,
‘⁶ atque ferarum, ¹

“ Antiquusque (1011105, 01 nota cubilia
⁶· linquunt.”

211. At rudis enituit, &c.] In the
King's manuscript it is aut; and in
one of Dr. Mead's it is ec: but in
1110 other manuscripts, and in most
os 1110 printed editions it is at.
ΜΓ. 13— makes the period to end
at selectim and takes tho description
of an uniit soil for corn to begin
with this line, which he translate
thus : ⁸

“ But where 1110. plough is urg'd on
‘⁶ rnhble ground,

‘² Nothing, but whitening furrows,
‘⁶ will be found.

‘⁴ This, says hc, is another of those
“ passages which all the Commenta„
“ tors have misunderstood, more or
‘⁶ less, for want of some knowledge
“ of country affairs. Ruaeus, ac-
“ cording to his usual custom, only
“ abstracts Pantanus. virgil speaks
“ herc of three sorts of soil, two of
“ which are fit for corn, the other
‘⁶ not. The first he describes thus3 a.
“ loose soil which looks dark and fat,
‘⁶ when turned up with 1110 plough.
“ Nigra sere, &c. The second is fo-
“ rest, or coppice ground. Aut unde
“ iratus sylvam, ἃς. The thirdffle
“ describes in a very poetica} manner,
“ by 1110 different effect 1110 plough
“ has upon it. At rudis enituit, &c.
‘⁶ The 10050 11011 ground, first men-
“ riom-d, looks dark, and fat, even be-
“ low 1110 piercing of the share, but
“ 1110 hard rubbly field, quite contra-
“ ry, is all white and shining‚ impulso
