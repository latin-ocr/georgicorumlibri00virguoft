NOTES.

and Dr. Trapp:

“ Or them aiirial crancs
‘⁶ Fled, rising from the valeS.”

 

La Cerda takes the meaning to be
that the showers rise out of the val-
lie53 interpreting it thus: ‘⁴ Grues
“ volatu suo altissimo indicant i1n-
“ brem surgere ab imis vallibus.’'
In this sense May translates it:

“ For from the vallies, e’er it thence
‘⁶ arise,
‘⁶ The cranes do fly.’⁹

Servius was aware of this interpreta-
tion and condemned it: “ Dicit
“ autem grues, de vallibus surgere,
“ non pluviam de vallibus surgere.⁷'
Α third interpretation is, that the
eranes left their aerial ssight, aud fled
or avoided the coming storm, by re-
treating to the low vales. In this
sense only Mr. Β has trans-
lated it ε

 

“ Graues, as it rose, ssew downwards
“ to the valea>

This interpretation is agreeable to
what Aristotle has said, in the ninth
book of his- history of Animals,
where treating of the foresight of
craneS, he says they fly on high, that
they may see far off, andis they per-
ceive clouds and storms, they descend,
and rest on the ground: Εἷς ὕψος
πέτονται, πρὸς τὸ καθορᾶν w} νωόξξω.
Καὶ Ξσὲν ἴδωσι νέφπ, καὶ χειμέρια, κα-
ταπτᾶσαι ἡσυχάζουσιν. From this
high ssight of the cranes, we see the

propriety of the epithet ab'rz'oe ; and
we also find that not their fiying on
high, but their descent is to be
esteemed a sign of rain. Aratus also,
whom our Poet imitatos in his signs
of weather, says, the cranes leave
their airy flight, and return in wind-
mg mazes:

'ovs' ὑψοῦ ’γεράνων μακραὶ ςίχες αὐτοὶ
κέλευθοι

Tem-swa· ςροφάδες δὲ παλιμπετὲς ἀπο-
νεονται.

37-5. Aac bacula caelum, &c.]
Thus also Aratus:

Ka) βόες ἔθη τοι πάρος &duros ἔνέἴοιο,
Ου’ρανὲυ εἷσανιὲὅντες, ἀπ’ αῖθέρος ω’σφρῆ·

σαντθ·

Virgil has imitated and almost tran-

scribed some verses of Varro Ata- '

cinus, which I shall here set down, as
{Jfind them in Servius, and F ulvius
rsmus :

‘⁶ Tum liceat pelagi volucres, tar-
“ daeque paludis

“ Cernere inexpleto studio certare
“ lavandi:

(ί Etvelut insolitum pennis infundere
“ rorem:

ί( Aut arguta lacus circumvolitavit
“ hirundo:

“ Et bos suspiciens caelum, mirabile
“ visu,

“ Naribus aerium patulis decerpsit
“ odorem: ν ¹
“ Nec tenuis formica cavis non ex-

“ tulit ova.
