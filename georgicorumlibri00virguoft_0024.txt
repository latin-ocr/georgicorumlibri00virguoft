xiv THE ΡΒΕΕΑΟΕᾹ

curious remarks of Father Catrou, whose French edition
of Virgil did not fall into my handS, till the greatest part
of the first Georgick was printed, which is the reason that Ι
have not quoted him sooner. But I did not depend entirely
on these learned Commentators; and have often ventured
to differ from them, for which I have assigned such reasons,
as I believe will be found satisfactory. They were all un-
acquainted with the subject, and therefore could not avoid
falling into considerable and frequent errors. When the sense
of any word or expression has been doubtful, or variously
interpreted‚ Ι have endeavoured to find how it has been
used by the Poet himself in other parts=0f his workS, and
by this means have sometimes removed the ambiguity.
If this has failed, I have consulted the other authors,
who wrote about the same time; and after them, the
earliest critickS‚ who are most likely to have retained
the true meaning. With regard to the precepts themselves,
I have compared thern with what is to be found in Aristotle,
Cato and Varro, whom our author himself evidently con·-
sulted3 and with those of Columella, Pliny, and Palladius,
who wrote before the memory of Virgil's rules was lost in
the barbarous ages. Ι have generally given the very words
of the author, whom Ι find occasion to cite, not taking them
at second hand, as is too frequent, but having recourse to
the originals themselves·

I am not conscious of having assumed any observation,
for which Ι am indebted to any other. The reader will find
many, which 1 am persuaded are not to be met with in
any of the commentators. Ι have been very particular in
my criticisms on the plants mentioned by Virgil: that
being the part, in which 1 am best able to inform him, and
which, I believe, has been chiefly expected from me. The
astronomical part has given me most trouble, being that
With which I am the least acquainted. But yet I may ven-
ture to lay the annotations on this subject before the reader,
with some confidence, as they have had the good fortune to
be ,perused by the greatest Astronomer of this, or perhaps of
any age3 the enjoyment of whose acquaintance and friend·
ship Ι shall always esteem as one of the happiest clrcum·
