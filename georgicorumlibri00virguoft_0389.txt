NOTES.

for the cicada is an insect of a very
flifferent sort. It has a rounder and
shorter body, is of a dark green co-
lour, sits upon trees, and makes a
noise five times louder than a grass-
hopper. They hegin their song as
soon as the sun grows hot, and con-
tinne singing till it sets. Their wings
are beautiful, being streaked with
silver, and marked with brown spotS.
The outer wings are twice as long
as the inner, and more variegated.
They are very numerous in the hot
countries, but have not been found
on this side the Alps and Cevennes.

The proper Latin name for a grass- «

hopper is locusta.

Tithonus the son of Laomedon,
king of Troy, was belored by Auro-
ra, and obtained of her an exceeding
long life. When he hadlived many
years, he at length dwindled into a
cicada.- thus Horace ε

“ Longa Tithonum minuit senectus.⁷>

The Poet is thought to allude to this
sable, when he uses the epithet que-
mig-O. Ilignis canalibus] Ilex is the
ever-green or holm oak. Pierius says
it is lignis for ligneis in the Roman

manuscript: Ι find in lignis in the
King's manuscript.

331. AEstibus at mediis umbrosam

exquirere vallem] “ In the Lombard
“ manuscript it is cestibus aut mediis .-
“ in some other ancient copies ac me.
‘² diis.- in the Lombard adquirere,
‘⁶ which I do not like. But Ι am not
“ displeased with at instead of aut,-
“ sor thus there are four precepts to
‘⁶ be observed every day 3 to seed them
“ in the morning, to give them drink
‘⁴ at the fourth hour, to shade them
‘⁶ at noon, and to seed· them again in
‘⁴ the evening.'’ Fuimus.
I find ac in some old editions : it is
aut in the King's manuscript, et in
one of Dr. Mead's, and ut in the old
Venice edition of 1482. But at is
generally received.

This precept of shading the sheep
at noon is taken from Varro: “ Cir.
‘4 citer meridianos aestus, dum defer-
‘4 vescant, sub umbriferas rupes, et
‘⁵ arbores patulas subjiciunt, quoad
‘⁶ refrigerato aere vespertino, rursus
(ζ pascant ad solis occasum.” We
find an allusion to this custom, in the
Canticles: ‘⁶ Te'll me, Ο thou whom
“ my soul loveth, where thou feedest,
“ where thou makest thy flock to rest
‘⁴ at noon.''
