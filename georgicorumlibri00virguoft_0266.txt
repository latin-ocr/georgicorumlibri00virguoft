sharp-pointed myrtle3 and is there-
fore the same With the κενἹρομυὲῥίνη,
or prickly myrtle of Theophrastus, to
which he compares the Alexandrian
laurel⁷ on account of the berries
growing upon the leaves: ’Ίὲια δὲ

describes our hutclzwer'shroom under
the name of μυρσίνη ἀγρία, or wild
myrtle. IIe says the leaves are like
those of myrtle, but broader, pointed
like a spear, and sharp. The sruit is
round, growing on the middle of the
leaf, red when ripe, and haviuga bouy
kernel. Many stalks rise from the
same root, a cubit high7bendiug7 hard
to break, and full of leaves. The
-root is like that of dog's ἔκιες, of a
sour taste and bitterish. It grows in
wild and craggy places: Μυρσίνη ἀγρία

butcher’s broom is so called, because
our butchers make use of it to sweep
their stalls. It grows in woods and
bushy places. In Italy they fre-
quently make brooms of it. I sup-
pose it was used to bind their vines in
Virgil's time, by it's being mentioned
iu this place.

414. Sylvam] It is sylvus in the
King’s manuscript.

416. Jam vincta: vitm, &c.] He
concludes this passage with showing
that the labour of cultivating vine.
yards is perpetual. He has already
mentioned a frequent digging of the
ground3 the summer and autumn
pruning3 and the tying of the vines.
Now he observes, that when all this
is performed, and the labour might
seem to be ended with the vintage,
yet the ground is still to be stirred
aud broken to dust3 and that storms
are to be seared even when the grapea ,
are ripe.

In the King’s, and in one of Dr.
Mead's manuscripts, it is junctoe in-
stead of vinctoe.

417. J am canit extremos effoetus·
vinitor antes] It is effectos in the
Bodleian, and effectus iu one of Dr.
Mead’s manuscripts. Pierius saysitis ·
