GEORG. LIB. ΙΙΙ.

Illi alternantes multa vi praelia miscent
Vulneribus crebris: lavit atercorpora sanguis,
Versaque in obnixos urgentur cornua vasto
Cum gemitu, reboant sylvaeque et magnus

Olympus.

Nec mos bellantes una stabulare:
Victus abit, longeque ignotis exulat oris,
Multa gemens ignominiam, plagasque superbi
Victoris; tum quos amisit inultus amores3
Et stabula aspectans regnis excessit avitis.
Ergo omni cura vires exercet, et inter

Dura jacet pernix instrato saxa cubili,

wliilst they mutually engage
with great force in b mle uim
frequent wounds, the black
gore distains theirhodies3t11eir
horns are violently urgfsd a-
gainst each other, with vast
roaring, and the woods and
great Olympus rebellow. Nor
do the warriors use to dwell to-
gether 3 but the vanquished re-
sed alter tires, and becomes an exilem
vously lamenting his disgrace,
and the woundsof the proud
victor, and liis loves which he
has lost unrevenged3 and cast-
iug his eye back at the stans,
departs stom liis hereditary
realrns. Ther-enne with all
diligente he exercises his
strength, and obstinately
makes his bed on the hard
smus-s, and seeds on rouglx
laaves and slmrp ruslies5

220. Ille· alternantes multa ὀἱ prce-
lia miscent.]Thus in the twelfthAEneid:

“ Illi inter sese multa vi vulnera
‘⁶ miscent,

‘⁴ Cornuaque obnixi infigunt, et san-
‘⁶ guine largo

“ Colla armosque lavant: gemitu ne-
“ mus omne remugit.”

Itis tollunt instead of miscent in
one ot' Dr. Mead’s manuscripts,

2‘26. Multa.] Itis generally thought
to be put adverbially: but La Cerda
is of another opinion, who thus para..
phrases this passage: ‘⁶ Gemit dolet-
‘⁶ que multa, videlicet ignominiam
“ amissae gloriae, acceptas plagas,
‘⁶ amores perditos.”

230. Pernic] So I read with
Servius, who explains pernix perseve-
rans, and derives it α pernitendo.
Pierius says it is pernix in all the ma-‚
nuscripts which he had seen, and
speaks of pernox as an innovation.
The King’s, and one of the Arundelian
manuscripts, most of the old editions,

Paul Stephens, La Cerda, Heinsius,

ΥΞ

and Masvicius, have pernix. The
Cambridge, the Bodleian, the other
Arundelian, aud both Dr. Mead⁷s
manuscripts have pernox. Ruaeus
contends, that it ought to be pernooe,
and affirms that pernix has no where
the signification which Servius as-
signs to it, but always means swift,
as pernix Saturnus, and pedibus
celerem et pernicibus alis. He says
it cannot be supposed that Virgil
would call his wearied bull Soeg'ft,
and therefore he reads pernos with
the two Scaliger& Grimoaldus also
readspernox. La Cerda says all the-
old copies read pcrm'sc, which he ex.
plains laboriosus, ol)stiuntus,pertz'71(1x,
and derives from the old verb perne·-
tor, with Servius. If pernox be ad-
mitted, our translation must be:
‘⁶ and makes his bed all night on the
“ hard stones.''

231. Carice neuim] This plant
has so little said of it by the Roman
writers, that it is hard to ascertain
what species we are to understand by
the name carex. It is here called

shurp, which, if it-be. meant of tbg
eu

unknown distant coasts, grie· ⁷
