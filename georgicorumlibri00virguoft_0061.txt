NOTES.

for geese, tells us, it must be that sort
which the Greeks call σέρις “ Sed
“ praecipue genus intubi, quod σέριν
“ Graeci appellant.” Dioscorides tells
us there are two sorts of σέρις, one
wild, and the other cultivated: the
wild sort is called ωίκρις and succor3:

ΣΞ Ξρῦς άγρία] καί ημξρῦς. (ἓν ’ἢ με ,ν CC'Jfboe wll? ἰζ’
ἦ και κιχωριον καλεμέιιη. It is called
πὶκρις 110 doubt from it's bittertness

whence Virgil describes it to be
amaris fibris. It is a very common
weed about the borders of our corn
fields3 and may be two ways inju-
rious. The spreading of its roots
may desti-oy the corn3 and, as it is a
proper food for geese, it may inxite
those destructive animals into the
fields where it grows La Cen-da, in
his note on this passage, takes occa-
sion to correct an error which has
crept into the editions of Pliny In
lib. 8. cup. 27. he says, ‘⁶ Fastidium
“ “purgant anateS, anseres, caetc-

 

“raeque aquaticae herba siderite.’'
That judicious commentator observes
that we ought to read seride instead
of siderite.

121. Umbra nocet] That trees
mershading the corn are injurious to
it, is known to ev·ei3 b0d3.
Poet has said the same thing in his
tenth Eclogue:

“ Nocent et frugibus 1111111133.υ

may not repine at so many obstacles
thr-own in his way, after all his la-
bour, the Poet in a beautiful manner
informs him, that Jupiter himself,
when he took the government of the
world upon him, was pleased to or-
dain, that men should meet with
many difficulties, to excite their in·
(lustry, and prevent their minds from
rusting with indolence and sloth.

1⁴22. Primus per artem movit agros]
Mr. Β has justly observed, that
this does not mean that Jupiter in-
vented ssliage, but that “ he made
“ it necessary to stir the ground,
“ because he filled it with weeds,
“ and obliged men to find out ways
‘⁶ to destroy them.’' Servius seems
to think that morit may be inter-
preted jussit coli. The Poet tells
us presently afterwards, that Ceres
was the inventor of husbandry. Dry-
den was not aware of this when he
wrote

 

“ Himself invented first the shining
“ share,

“ And whetted human industry by
‘⁶ Care ;

“ Himselt' did handicrafts and arts
‘⁶ ordain.'’

Ovid also ascribes the invention of
agriculture to Cerea in the fifth book
of his Metamorphosis:

‘⁴ Prima Ceres unco glebam dimovit
“ aratro:
