NOTES.

“ coeno aut stercore, sed exitiosis
“ quoque serpentibus tecta liberen-
(ἦ tur.'’ Immotis therefore in this
'place means such places as have not
been duly swept and cleansed.

417. VzPera] Servius thinks that
the vipera is so called quod vipart'at ;
others, with better reason„ think it
is so called ‘quod vivum pariat. And

⁴ indeed this animal differs from most
other serpents‚ in bringing forth it‘s
young alive3 whereas the rest lay
cggS. It is known in England under
the name of Viper or Adder. The
bite of it is very venomous3 tho’ it
seldom, is ever, proves mortal in our
climate. The most immediate re-
medy for this bite is found to be olive
ἔ oil applied instantly to the injured
, part. See Phil. Trans. N. 443.p. 313.
ῃ and N. 4-14.p. 394.
Ι 418. Coluber ...... pestis acerba
Ι ὸοιιιη.] Ι take the serpent here meant,
' to be that which Pliny calls boas.
This author affirms that they grow
² sometimes to a prodigious bigness‚
and that there was a child found in
l the belly of one of them, in the reign
of Claudius. He adds that they seed
’μου (30(ψέ milk, whence they have ob-
ftained tlieirname. The words of
Pliny are quoted in the note on book
II. ver. 374.
