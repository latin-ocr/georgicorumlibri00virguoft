name for what the Greeks called
σέλινον. Theophrastus speaks of sc-
veral sorts: the ce'mw ἐ’μερ ν, which
ic generally thought to be our com-
mon Parsley3 thoe ἱπποσέλιντν, which
seems to be what ive call Alexanders,
the {nemo-{mnus which is What We
call Smallage, and the ἕρεοσέλενον, or
mountain Parsley. Virgil is gene..
rally thought by apium to mean the
first sort, that being principally cul-
tivated in gardens. But I rather be-
liere he means the Smallage, of
which an agrceahle sort has been
brought from Italy under the name
of Celeri, and is nour cultivated al-
most every where. The Smallage
or Celeri delights in the banks of
rivulets, and therefore our Poet says
virides apio τέρα), andpole's gauderent
rivis. Columella must also mean
the same herb under the name of
apium, without any epithet, when

— hesaysit delights in water, and should

be placed near a spring: ‘⁶ Apium
“ quoque possis plantis serere, nec
‘⁴ minus semine, sed praecipue aqua
‘⁶ laetatur, et ideo secundum fontem
‘⁶ commodissime ponitur.’' Apiam
:is thought to be derived from apes,
because Bees are fond of that

plant.
Tariusque per herbam cresceret ἰη
ventrem cucumis] In the King's
manuscript, and in the old Paris edi-
tion, printed in 1494, it is herbas,
instead of herbam.
The Poet gives a beautiful do-
,scriptiou of the cucumber in a few

words. The winding of the stalle
aleon-g the ground, and the swelling
of the frui t, excellently distinguish
these plants.

We have no reason to doubt, but
that the Narcissus of the Ancients is
some specics of that which we now
call Narcissus or Daffodil. Theo-
phrastus says it has its leaves spread
on the ground like the Asphodel, but
broader, like those of Lilies: its stalk
is void of leaves, and bears at the top
a herbaceons flower, and a large dark
coloured fruit enclosed in a mem-
branaceous vessel of an oblong figure.
This fruit falling down sprouts spon..
taneously, though some gathcr it for
sowing. The roots also are planted,
which are large, round, and fleshy.
It fiowers xery late after the rising
of Arcturus, and about the verna!
