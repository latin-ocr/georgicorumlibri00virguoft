NOTES.

137. Rapiat Venerem] Thus

Ilorace ε

“ -—— Venerem incertam rapientis.’'

138. Rursus cura patrum, &C.]
The Poet having given us full instruc-
lions about the care of the male, now
'tells us that after conception, the
whole care is to be transferred to the
female. He then takes occasion to
mention ‘the Asilus7 which is a terri..
ble plague to the cows in Italy.

143. Non illas gravibus quisquam

ι juga ducereplaustris . . . sit passus]
‘Thus Varro: “ Cum conceperunt
“ equce7 videndum ne aut laborent
“ plusculum, ἅμ”

In one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts

⁷ it is gravidis instead of gra-cibus.

143. Saltibus] See the note on
,10150 471. of the second Georgick.

Pusccml] In one of the Arunde..
lian manuscripts it is pascunt.

Plena secundum flumina] The
Poet recommends full rivers7 that

s the pregnant cattle may not strain
themselves with stooping to drink.

144. Viridz'ssz'ma gramine ripa]
ThusVarro, speaking of cons, “ Eas
“ pasci oportet in 10015 viridibus, et
‘⁶ aquosis.''

In one os Dr. Mead’s manuscripts
it is germine instead of gramine.

146. Est lucos.] Seneca reads Et
lacum.

Silari] Silarus was the name of
a river, 11111011 dixided the. country of
the Picentini, from that of the chcmzc‘.
Is now called Selo.

Clara] Seneca reads juxta.

[levibusque virentem] The epithet
virentem is very proper3 for the ho'lm.
mdc, or ilex, is an evergreen.

147. Plurimus] “ This plurimusf :
‘⁶ says Dr. Trapp. may seem odd: for
“ Asilas is plainly understood as a-
“ greeing with it. And then Asilas,
‘⁴ cuz· nomen Asilo looks strange. But
“ we must recur to the sense3 which
“ is the same, as isit had been Plu..
“ rima musca cui n0711enAs2·l0.” Asi.
Ins cuz* nomen Asilo is La Cerda's in-
terpretation, which, I must acknow.
lvdge, seems a little strange. But

surely plurimus agrees with volitfifzsi:
