interpretation : but Grimoald us gives
another sense to this passage. lle

greatly exhaust the ground3 yet you
may easily remedy this inconvenience,
by letting the ground lie. sallon· one

arran] The sense of this passage is,
that the change of grain is of service
to the ground, and in some mensure
nnswers the same end as letting it lie

auges the husbandman to let his

him that his forbearance will be well
rewarded. Thus at the beginning
of this Gfflngick, he tells us, that a
husbandman, who lets his ground lie
fallow two years, will reap such an
abundant emp, that his barns will

Grimoaldus does not understand
this passage as it is commonly under-
stood ; that the Poet proposesso many
different, and eren contrary conjec-
tures, concerning the benefit accru-
ing from burning a barren field. Ile
rather thinks thut Virgil intends to
describe these four cures for so many
causes of bamuness. If the soil be
poor, burning will make it fat and full
of juice: if it be watry, the beat
will make the superfluous moisture
transpire: if it be a stiff clay. the
warmth will open the μοι-95, and re-
lax the stiffness : is it he a spongy and
thirsty soil, the lire will bind and
condense it. La, Cerda quotes Bers-
manus for the same interpretation:
and approves of it.

Virgil is generally thought not to
hare intended to speak ofburning the
ground itself‚ but only of burning the
stubble. Pliny seems to understand
him in this sense: “Sunt qui ac-'
“ cendunt in arvo et stipulas, mag-
“ no Virgilii praeconio.” Servius
in his comment, on these words, in-
cendere prosilit egum, says, “ Non
“ agros, sed ea quae in agris sunt', id
‘⁶ est stipulas vel quisquilias: hoc est
