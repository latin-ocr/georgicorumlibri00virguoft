for where sne buds thrust
themselves forth, out of the
middle of the burk, and break
the thin memorant-s, a small
slit is to be made in ihc very

stocks are cut, und a way is
made into the solid wood wixh

NOTES.

‘⁴ vest-es Fraxini sunt, paulo latioribus
‘⁶ tamen foliis quam caeterae fraxini,
“ nec deteriorem frondem quam Ul-
“ rni praestant.''

Ι have sometimes suspected that
the Ornus may be that sort of Ash,
from which the manna is said to be
gathered in Calabria, and which Cas-
par Bauhinus brought out of Italy,
under the name of Ormcs 3. Galli
Brixiam de Re rustica. Both he and
his brother John Bauhinus have called
it Fraxinus rotundiore folio.

72. Glandemqnc sues fivgere sub
Ulmis] In the King's, and one of
Dr. Mead‘s manuscripts, I find
glandes instead of glandem.

Pliny has committed an error in
quoting this passage, sor he says that
virgil speaks of ingrasting cherries
upon elms: “ Quippe cum Virgilius
·‘ insitam nucibus arbutuin, malis
“ platanum, cerasis ulmum ‹licat.''

7 3. Inserere acque oculos imponere]
Here the Poet shows the differcnce
between grafting and inoculating.
Iuoculation‚ or budding, is perform-
ed by making a slitin the bark of
one trec, and inserting tho bud of
another into it. There are several
ways of grafting now iu use, but the

only ono, which Virgil describes, is
what we call dest-grafting, which is
performed by cleaving 1118 head of
the stock‚ and placing a cion from
another trec in the cleft.

78. Trmzci.] We call the body of
a tree the trzmlc: but truncus is not
used for the body, unless the hcad be
cut off. The body of a treve, when
it is adorned with it’s branchos, 15
called caudeoe or codeces.

82. Illiraturque]
mirata estque.

To conclude the notes on this pas·
sage about ingrafting and inoculating:
it seems impossible not to observe the
beautiful manner in which our Poet
has described them. The variety of
expression which 118 has used in speak-
ing of the different sorts of ingrastcd
treeS, and the various epithcts he be·
stows on thom, render this passage
excccdingly delightful. The arbuto
is distinguished by its ruggedness3
the plane by it’s barren shade3 and
the pcar by it's snowy blossoms. lt
would have become a prose writer,
simply to have said that any cion
may be ingrafted on any stock: but
a Poet must add bcauty to bis in·
structionis, and convey the plainest
