N OT Es,

Tantalus, the father of Pelops had
invited the gods to a banquet‚ at
which, having a mind to try their
divinity‚ he dressed his son, and set
his flesh before them. All the gods
abstained from this horrid food‚ ex.
cept Ceres, who eat the shoulder.
Jupiter afterwards restored Pelops to
life, and gave him an ivory shoulder,
instead of that which had been eaten.

9. Victorque viram volitare per
orm] Thus Ennius:

GC

 

Volito docta per ora virum.”

10. Primus ego in patriam, δια]
The Poet⁷ having in the preceding
paragraph expressed his contempt of
the fabulous subjects of the Greek
Pom, and shewn a desire of sur-
passing thern, now proceeds to pro-
pose to himself a subject worthy of
his genius, not founded on fables,
but on true history. The historical
facts which he designs to celebrate are
the victories of the Romans, under
the influenceof Augustus Caesar. He
poetically describes this victory of his
over the Greek Poets, by a design of
building a temple to Augustus, on
the banks of the Mincius, and of.
ficiating himself as priest. In the
mean time he says he will proceed
in the present work, and speak of

cat[tilii-s boast of Virgil, that he will

be the first, who brings the Muses

from Helicon into his own country.
must be understood os Mantua, not
of Italy in general: for this glory
belongs to Ennius, who first wrote
an epic poem, after the manner of
Homer. Thus Lucretius :

‘4 Ennius ut noster cecinit, qui pri„
‘⁶ mus amoeno

(ί Detulit ex Helicone perenni fronde
“ coronam

‘⁶ Per gentes Italas hominum quae
‘⁶ clara clueret.’'

Tho’ perhaps our Poet might not
think Ennius to have succeeded so
well, as to be thought to have gain-
ed the favour of the Muses3 and
therefore flattered himself that he
might be the first Roman, who ob..
tained that 'glory. It must not be
omitted in this place, that Virgil de.
signed a journey into Greece, a little
before his death. This part therefore
probably was written after the Geor-
gicks were finished.

11. Aonio vertice] Aonia was
the name of the mountainous part
of Boeotia, whence all Boeotia came
to be called Aonia. In this country
was thersamous mountain Heliconi
sacred to the Muses. ,,

12. Idumaeas palmas] Idumaea„
or the land of Edom, was famous sor
palms. He therefore uses Idumaean

palms for palms in general, ‘as is V·

common in poetry. Palms were 'used
