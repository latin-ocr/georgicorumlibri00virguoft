Heinsius, and several of the old edi-
tions. Servius, and after him most
of the editors read dividet.

210. Hordea] Servius informs
us that Bavius and Maevius were
greatly offended at Virgil, sor using
hordea in theplural number: andex-

pressed their resentment 1111110101-
lowing verse :

“ H‘ogdea qui dixit, superest ut tritica
‘ icat.''

Hence it seems that the objections,
which those ancient Criticks made
to Virgil were only grammatical ca-
vils.

211. Usque sub extremum brumae
intractabilis imbrem] Bruma cer-
tainly means the winter solstice : but
what Virgil means by the last shower
of itI must acknowledge myselfun-
able to explain. Pliny understands
our Poet to mean that barley is to be
sown between the autumnal equinox
and the winter solstice. “ Virgilius
“ triticum et far a vergiliarum occasu
“ seri jubet, hordeum inter aequi-
“ noctium autumni et brumam.''
The same author tells us expressly
that barley is to be sown only in dry
weather: “ Hordeum, nisi sit sic-
“ cum, ne serit0.” Palladius speaks
of sowing barley in September, Oc-
tober, and November3 but says it is
full late to sow it in December:
“ Decembri mense seruntur frumen—
“ ta, triticum, sar, hordeum, quam-
“ vis hordei satio jam sera sit.''

These directions of Pliny and Palla-
dius seem by no means to agree with
Virgil’s extending the sowing time to
the last shower of the solstice. The
autumna} equinox, in Virgil's time,
was about the twenty-fourth of Sep-
tember3 and the winter solstice about
the twenty-fifth of December. Hip-
parchus, according to Columella,
places it on the seventeenth of De·
cember, and the Chaldeans on the
twenty-fourth. According to Pliny
it was on the twenty-fifth : ‘⁶ Bruma
“ Capricorni ab vin. calend. Ja-
“ nuarii fere.”

The Poet calls the winter 501511οῳ
intractabilis, because the cold, which
comes at that season, begins to put a
step to the labours os the ploughman.
That the cold begins to be severe at
that time, even in Italy, we have the
testimony of Lucretius:

‘⁸ Tandem bruma nives adfert, pi·
“ grumque rigorem

“ Reddit, Hyems sequitur, crepitans
“ ac dentibus Algus.'’

21‘2. Liui] Columella and Palla-
dius agree with virgil about the time
of sowing flax. Columella says it is
from the first os October to the se·
venth of December: “ Seritur a Ca·
“ lendris Octobris in ortum Aquilae,
“ qui est vn. Idus Decembris.”
Palladius says the time sor sowing of
it is October: ‘⁶ Hoc mense lini se-
“ men seremus.” And again, under
December, he 5355, “ Hoc etiam

E 4· “ mense
