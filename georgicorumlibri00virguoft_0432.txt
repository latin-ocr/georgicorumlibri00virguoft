550. Phillyrides Chiron, Amy-
thaoniasque illelampus] Chiron
was the son of Saturn and Philyra,
as was observed in the note on rer.
92. &Vhen he was grown up, he
retired to the woods, and having there
learned‘the nature and virtues of
plants, he became an excellent Phy-
sician3 and the herb Cenlazcrgs had
its name from this famous Centaur.
sse instructed AEsculapius in Physic‚
Hercules in Astronomy, andAcliilles
in Music. He was a practical astro-
nomer, and is thought, together with
Musaeus, to have srarned the first
sphere that was ever made among the
Greeks, sor the use of the Argo-
nautic expedition, 111 which he had
two grandsons engaged. He is sup-
posed by Sir Isaac Newton‚ to have

been about eighty-eight years old at
that time.

Melampus was the son of Amy-
thaon and Dorippe. Ile was said to
be famous sor augum, and to under.

stand the voices of birds and other
animals. He was also a most famous
Physician, and had a temple erected
to 111111, with the institution of solemn
feasts and sacrifices. He assisted
ssias in taking away the oxen of
l1›hicluS‚ and cured the daughters of
Proetus of their madness.

Hence we may observe, that Vir-
gil did not suppose the pestilence here
described to be the same with that at
Athens, but several years more an..
cient, even before the Argonautic
expedition. For we have seen al-
ready, that Chiron was an old inan
at the time of that expedition. Iphi-
clus, whose oxen Melampus took
away, was the twin-brother of Her-
cules, who was an Argonaut. The,
age of Proetus is not very certain;
only thus much we may affirm, that
he lived many years before the Ar-
gonautic expedition. Chiron there-
sore and Melampus were conteni-
pormries, and this pestileuce hap-
pening in their time, was before
the Argonautic expedition, not less
than sive hundred years before the
famous Plague of Athens.
