by which they are produced without

by suckers.

ll. Sponte sua veniunt] Tho’ the ¹

pontan( ons generation of plants is

now sufficiently exploded3 yet it was
universally believed by the ancient
philosophers. Instances of this are
frequent in Aristotle, Pliny, and many
others-

12. Silam] Ι have followed the
general opinion, in translating Siler,
an Osz'er. [ (10 not meet with any
thing certain, in the other Latin
writers, to determine exactly what
plant they meant. Pliny says only,
that it delights in watery places:
whence I wonder that Caesalpinus
should imagine it to be the Euonymus
Theophrasti, or Spindle-tree, which
grows usually in hedges. La Cerda
sancies it to be the Siler montanum,
or Ser-mountain, because he thinks it
more (legant for the Poet to speak
of two which growr in the plains,
and two 111 the rivers. But this seems
too trifiing an exactness, to be worth
insisting upon: and I do not find
any other S'z’ler, to be mentioned in
any ancient Latin author, but that
which grows in th'e water.

Genista to be what we call Spanish
broom 3 which grows in great plenty,
in most parts of Italy. The Italian's ⁷
