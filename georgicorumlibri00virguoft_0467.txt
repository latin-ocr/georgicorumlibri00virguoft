GEORG. LIB. IV.

Jamque ministrantem platanum potantibus umbras.
x Verum haec ipse equidem spatiis exclusus iniquis
Praetereo, atque aliis post me memoranda relinquo.

spread a shade over those who
drank under it. But for my
part, asI am conflned in too
narrow a space, Ι must pass

tree ; and because our wild sort,
which bears the 51065, 15 called the
blac-lc thorn.

146. Platanztm] See thenote on
book ΙΙ. ver. 70.

Umbram] Schrevehus, Paul Ste-
phens, and some others 'read umbram.
Pierius found umbras in all the anci-
ent manuscripts. It is umbras in 311
111056, which I have collated.

Before we leave these verses, where-
in the Poet speaks of transplanting
great trees, it may not be improper
to set down what our famous Evelyn
has said on this subject.

⁶⁶ A great Person in Devon‚ plan-
⁶⁶ ted oaks as big as twelve oxen
⁶⁶ conl-d draw, to supply some defect
⁶⁶ in an avenne to one of his houses :
‘⁶ as the Right Honourable the Lord
⁶⁶ Fitz-Harding, late Treasurer of
⁶⁶ his Majesty's Household assured
⁶⁶ me3 who had himselflikewisc prae-
‘⁶ tised the removing ofgreat 03115 by
⁶⁶ a particular address extreamlyinge-
⁶⁶ nicus, and worthy the communi..
⁶⁶ cation. Chuse a trec as big as
‘⁶ your thigh, remove the earth from
⁶⁶ about him3 cut through 1111 1116
⁶⁶ collateral 10015, 1111 with a compe-
‘⁶ tent strength you can cnforce him
‘⁶ down upon one side, 50 asto 001116
⁶⁶ with your ax at the top root3 cut
‘⁶ that off, redress your 1106, and 50
⁶⁶ let it stand covered about with the
⁶⁶ mould you loosened from 11, 1111
⁶⁶ the next year, or longer if you
‘⁶ think good, then take it up at a fit

⁶⁶ season 3 it will likely have drawn
⁶⁶ new tendet roots apt to take, and
⁶⁶ sufficient for the 1166, wheresoever
⁶⁶ you shall transplant him. Some
⁶⁶ are for laying bare the whole root,
⁶⁶ and then ‹lividingit into four partS‚
⁶⁶ in form of a cross, to cut away the
⁶⁶ interjacent rootlingS‚ leaving only
⁶⁶ the cross and master-roots that
⁶⁶ were spared to support the tree ;
⁶⁶ and then covering the pit with
⁶⁶ fresh mould (as above) after a year
⁶⁶ or two, when it has put forth,
⁶⁶ and furnished the interstices yon
⁶⁶ left between the cross-roots, with
⁶⁶ plenty of new fibres and tcnder
⁶⁶ 5110015, you may safely remove the
⁶⁶ 1166 115011, so soon as you have
⁶⁶ loosened and reduced the four de-
⁶⁶ cussated 10015, and shortned 1110
⁶⁶ top roots3 and this operation is
⁶⁶ done without stooping or bending-
⁶⁶ the tree at all: and if in removing
⁶⁶ it with as much of the clod about
⁶⁶ the new 10015, 35 possible, it would
⁶⁶ be much better.'’
