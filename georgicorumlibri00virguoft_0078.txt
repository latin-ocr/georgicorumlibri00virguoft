other ancient manuscripts. One of
Dr. Mead's manuscripts has illudant.-
it is the same in the editions of Hein-
sius and Paul Stephens. Servius and
most of the editors admit dludunt.
Eoeigmw musa] Quintilian justly
observes that not only the diminishing
epithet, but the ending of the verse
with one syllable, beautifully express-

es the littleness of the animal:

'“ Risimus, et merim, nuper poetam
“ qui dixerat,

“ Prae-textam in cista mures rosere

“ At Virgilii miramur illud,
‘⁴ Saepe exiguus mus.

speaks according to the vulgar opi·

this passage he shews the husbandman
how he may form a judgment of his
future harvest.

to be unanimous in rendering nux the
almond-tree: but Ι cannot discover
upon what grounds, l believe nm: has
never been used, without some epi-
thet, to express an almund-eree. That
it is used for a walam-trec, is plain
from Ovid's poem de Nuce. V irgil
says in the. second Georgick‚ that tho
nux is ingrasted on the arbutus:

“ Inseritur vero ex foetu nucis arbu-
“ tus horrida.’'

That this is to be understood of the
wulnut, appears from Palladius:

“ Arbuteas frondes vastae nucis occu-
“ pat umbra

“ Pomaque sub duplici cortice tuta.

Palladius could not mean the almond,
when he spoke ofagreat shade,which

is very applicable to the walnut. In
