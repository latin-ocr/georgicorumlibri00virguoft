NOTES.

ξ( sum⁷ viget. Secant agricolai, scin-
‘⁴ dumque in partes plures caudicem

32, Alterius ramos impune videmus
vertere ἐπ alterius] ln this passage
he plainly speaks os grafting, of
which he subjoins two instances. This
subject is fai-ther explained ς ver. 73.

33. DIutatamque insita mala ferre
Pyrum] He speaks os grafting ap.
ples upon a pear stwk, not of pears
upon an, apple-stock‚ as Dryden has
transiated it, who has added quinces

aisn, tho’ not in the original:

‘⁶ Thus pears and quinces from the
“ crab-tree come.’'

DIutccz‘am agrees with Pyrum ; now
it is the nature of the stock, not of
the graft that is changed: wherefore
’ the pear must be the stock spoken of
in this place. The appies are said to
be insila, ingrasted, which fully ex.
plains the meaning of this passage.

34. Prum's lapidosa rubescere Cor-
na.] lt is a doubt whether virgil
means, that Cornels are ingrafted
upon plumb-stocks‚ or plumbs upon
eornelrsiockS. May takes it in the
former sense :

“ And hard red cornoiles from astock
of plumme :

and Dr. Trapp:

‘⁶ And on the plumb’s the stony cor-
“ nel glow.'’

Dryden takes it in the latter sense z

‘² And flius the ruddy cornel bears
‘⁶ the plum‘:

and ΜΡ. Β--ε

‘⁴ And sfony coi-neiis blush with
‘⁴ blooming plumS.

Ι take the former to be the Poet’s
meaning: for the Cornelian cherry is
a fruit of so beautiful a red colour,
that the cornel cannot properly be
said to glow or redden with plumbs,
which are not -so red as it’s own na..
tural fruit. Besides the epithet stony
beiongs very properly to the fruit of
the Cornol, not to the tree ε where-
fore if Virgil speaks of that fruit, he
must mean the stock of the plumb.
Columella says the Cornelian cher.
ries wei-e used sor olives: ‘⁶ Coma,
‘⁶ quibus pro olivis utamur.”

37. Javat Ismara Baccho conse-
rere] Ismarus is a mountain of

Thrace, not sar from the mouth of
Hebrus.
