NOTES.

‘⁶‘ coeunt, si macrae suut, et deLY'i-
“ tantur, et debiles creant: post
-“ primum autem parturn tenues esse
“ debent.” But I do not find this
distinction made by the writers on
Husbandry. Ruaeus says primos and
jam nota are inconsistent, unless pri-
mos relatos, not to the first covering,
but to the beginning of the year:
‘⁶ Pugnant hzec verba„ primos etjam
⁶⁶ nota. Nisijiixtaalios intelligamus
⁶‘ primos, non omnino de primo con-
‘⁶ cubitu3 sed tantum de primo et
‘⁴ novo anni cujusque redeuntis.’'
Accordingly his interpretation is,
‘⁶ Et cum voluptas prins cognita
“ suadet novum co'itum.’² Dr.T1-app
translates Ruaeus's note, and adds
“ and that is very untoward.’' Gri-
moaldus interprets it, ‘⁶ ubi primum
“ coire cupient:'’ and La Corda,
“ ubi jam sollicitantur voluptate ad
“ coitum‚” taking no notice either of
'primos orjam notu. Thus also May
translates it:

 

‘⁴ And when they have an ap-
⁶⁶ petite ’
“ To venery.'’

Dryden follows Ruaeus:

“ When oonseious of their past de.
‘⁶ light, and keen

,⁶⁶ To take the leap, and prove the
⁶‘ sport agen.'’

Dr. Trapp translates jam notu, but
takes no notice of concubitus primos.-

κ - When now the known dclight
‘⁶ Sollicits their desires.·2

ΜΓ. B-——‚ ΞΤ. Ti: {vrcsace to the
Georgicks, premas *go the second
book, gives quite ει new iaierpreta..
tion of this passage. Mr. Dryden‚
‘³ says lle, very untearnedly applies
‘⁶ nota voluptas to the mare, not.
‘⁶ considering that Virgil speaks here
“in the person of a Groom or
‘² Farmer, very well acqualnted with
‘² the passion those. creatures are most
“ subject to; and therefore nota vo-
‘⁶ heptas relates to the farmer's know..
“ ledge, beyond all manner of doubt;
“ and it is worth observation, through
“ all the Georgicks‚ that tho’ the
⁶‘ piece is what the Grammarians
‘⁶ call Deductae, yet the stile is ge-
⁶‘ nerally Epic.’‘ He then gives his
own translation of the passage now
‚before us, in the following words ε

“ As for the herd, they strive to.
“ keep them bare,

⁶⁶ And pinch‚ and draw them down
⁶⁶ with scanty sare ;

“ And when the zcell known passion
‘⁴ of their race

‘⁶ Sollicits instantly the first embrace,

‘⁶ Then they forbid them wandring in
‘⁵ the mods,

“ Cropping the bronze, and haunt.
“ ing lonely floods:

“ Ost in the scorching sun they
‘⁶ waste their force,

‘⁶ And urge them panting in the
⁶‘ furious course:

⁶⁶ Then groans the floor, to pounded
⁶‘ sheaves resign’d,

⁶‘ And empty straws are spurn'd a.
“ gainst the wind.‘’
