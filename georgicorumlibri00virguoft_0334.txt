114. chn'clis] Pierius says it is
rapidus in the Roman manuscript. I
find {he same reading in one of the
Arundelian manuscript& Serviusalso
and Heinsius read rapidus.

118. Frwna Pelethronii Lctpz'lhce
gyrosque declam] Servius says Pele-
tronium is {he name of a town of
Thessaly where the breaking of horses
was first invented. This interpreta-
tion is generally received, and there.
fore I have adhered to it in my trans..
lation. But Pliny makes Pelethro-
nius the name of a man, and says
Bellerophon invented t'he backing of
horses7 Pelethronins bridles and the
furniture of horses, and the Centaurs
of Thessaly the fighting on horse
back: ‘⁴ Equo vehi Bellerophontem,
‘⁴ fraenos et strata equorum Pelethro.
‘⁶ nium, pugnare ex equo Thessalos,
‘4 qui Centauriappellati sunt, habi..
‘⁶ tames secundum Pelium monlem.’'
Ovid however plainly uses Pelethro-
nium in the sense which Servius has
given it:

“ Vecte Pelethronium Macareus in
‘⁴ pectus adacto
‘⁶ Stravit Erigdupum.”

Gyras signifies properly a wheelz'ng (ι-
bont. Thus it is used, in the seventh AE-
neid, for the wheeling round of a top:

4‘ verbere turbo,

‘⁶ Quem pueri magno in gyro vacua
‘v‘ atria circum

‘⁶ Intenti ludo exercent.”

In the tenth AEnoid‚ when Mezen.
tius throws several daris at AEn‹›as‚
and then takes a great round, as it is
expressed by volat ingenti gyra

ί(

 

Dixit, telumque intorsit in
‘⁶ hostem

‘⁶ lnde aliud super atque aliud figit-
‘⁶ que voluique

‘⁶ Ingerzte'gyross'

Itis used in the, same manner, in
the eleventh Ᾰῧιιοίεἶ, to express Ca..
milla’s flying from Orsilochus, and
wheeling round, till she comes be-
hind him ε

⁴⁶ Orsilochum fugiens, magnumque

‘⁶ Eludit gyro interior, sequiturque
‘⁶ sequentem.”

In this place therefore it signifiesthe
managing a horse, and teac'ning all
the proper rounds and turns. May
