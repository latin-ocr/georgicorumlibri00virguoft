NOTES.

⁶⁶ et altera suae spontis, itemque sem-

‘per virens szcsss’

114. Ille etiam, &c ] Most ofthe
Commentators and Translators seem
not to have rightly apprehendet] the
meaning of this passage. ’111ιο Poet
plainly designs to express the great
skill of his old acquaintance, in re-
moving large trees. Every one of
the trees here mentioned has an epi-
thet added to it, to signify its being
well grown. The elms are called
serre, that ἰ5, laxe, old, orfargrown:
the pears are called hard ,· the
thorns are said to be already bear.
ing plzcmbs,· and the planes are ex-
pressly said to be already so large,
as to spread a shade, sufficient to
cover those who sit under them.
May seems' to have understood the
Poet’s meaning z

⁶⁶ He could to order old grown elms
‘⁶ transpose,

‘⁶ Old peare trees hard, and black
⁶⁶ thorne bearing sloes,

⁶⁶ The plaine tree too, that drinking
‘⁶ shade bestowes.''

Dr. Trapp's translation is not very
deficient:

‘⁶ 1Ιο too m ranks dispos'd the late-
‘grown elms,
“And the hard pear- -tree, and the
‘⁶ plumb (ν’ n then
‘⁶ Laden with fruitage3 and the plane

‘⁶ which yields

⁶⁶ To Bacchus's sons its hospitablo
‘⁶ shade.'’

But Addison has quite lost the sense
of his author:

‘⁶ ln rows his elms and knotty pean.
‘⁶ trees bloom,

‘⁶ And thorus ennobled now to bear
‘⁶ a plumb, ·

⁶⁶ And spreading plane- trees, where
⁶⁶ supinely laid

‘⁶ He now enjoys the cool and quaffs
‘⁶ beneath the shadev

And Dryden ε

“He knew to rank his elms in
‘⁶ even rows3

‘⁶ For fruit the grafted pear- -tree to
‘⁶ dispose·

‘⁶ And tame to plumbs the sour-
‘⁶ ness of the sloes.

⁶⁶ With spreading planes he made
⁶⁶ a cool retreat,

“To shade good follows from the
‘⁶ summer’s heat.''
