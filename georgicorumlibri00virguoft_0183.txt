NOTES.

Pliny also says that the Peloponnesus
is shaped, by the number of it’s bays,
like a plane leaf: ⁸‘ Platani folio si-
“ milis, propter angulosos recessu3.’'
To illustrate this similitude, which is
as just as we can expect in any thing
of this nature, I have added a figure
of the Peloponnesus, and ofa leaf of
a pl'ane-tree. 'l‘he Placemus is so call-
ed from πλαἿὸς broad, on account of
the remarkable breadth of it's leaves.
Pliny tells us thistree was first brought
over the Ionian sea, into the island of
Diomedes. s'or a monument for that
hero: thence imo Sicily, and so into
Italy.· “Sed quis· non jure miretur
‘⁸ arborem umbrae gratia tantum ex
“ alieno petitam orbe? Platanos
“ haec est, per mare Ionium in Dio-
“ medis insulam ejusdem tumuli
“ gratia primum invecta, inde in
“ Siciliam transgressa, atque. inter
“ primas donata ltaliae.'' It seems
the ancients had so profuse a venera-
tion for this trec as to irrigate it
with wine; thus Pliny: “ Tantum-
“ que postea honoris increvit, ut
“ mero infuso enutriantur: comper·
“ tum id maxime prodesse radicibus,
“ docuimusque etiam arbores vina
‘⁴ potare.'' The Poet calls the plane
barren, because it bears no fruit that
is eatabl‘e..

71. Castaneoe fagos] The. Com·-
mentators differ greatly about the
reading of this passage. Servius
reads ca-statneaefagos, but thinking it
absurd that a barren beech, as he
calls it, should be ingrafted on a
fruitful chesnut‚ he fancies either that
it is a hypallage, so that Castaneae
fagos is -for sagi castaneas.- οι· else

that we must make a stop at easta-
nceae, taking it for the genitive case
after malos-3 and making fagos the
nominative case with a Greek termi-
nati0n‚ this and the preceding verse
being to be read thus :

“ Et steriles platani-malos gessere vae
‘⁴ lentes

0‘ Castaneae: sagos, ornusque inca*
‘⁴ nuit,’' ὥς.

The first of these interpretationi, is
such, that, 1 believe, to mention it
is to confute it, 'l'he second inter-
pretation is not without it's followers.
Pierius says he has seen ‘castaneae
marked for the genitive case, in some
ancient copies: and Ascensius, as
he is quoted by Ruaeus, contends
for this reading. He takes malos to
signify, not epple—trees, but masis:
so that the sense will be, according
to this Critick, Plane-trees have borne
such strong brancha of chmmts, that
they seem to he mas-ts qs ships: but this,
as Ruaeus justlyobserves‚ is too harsh.
Others, says bessius, like neither of
these interpretations, but make cas-
taneae the genitive case aster flore,
and readfagus in the nominative case
singular. Thus it will be, “the
“bet-ch has been hoary with the
“ blossoms of chesnuts, and the
⁴⁸ m‹.untain ash with those. of the
“pear—tree.'' Ruaeus follows this
interpretation, and ΜΓ. Β

 

“Thus chesnut plumes on beech
‘⁶ surprise the sight,

‘⁴ And hornbeam blows with pear-
“ tree flowers all white.”
