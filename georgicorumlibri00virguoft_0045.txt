NOTES.

Mr. ss— translates virosa, heady. Dr.
Trapp observes that sirus and rene-
vum sometimes carry the sense of
φάρμακον, and so translates it,

“ Pontus, it’s castor's drug,”

which is very low.

59. Eliadum palmas Epiros equa-
νυνι] Elis is a country ot' Pelopon-
nesus, in which was the city Olym-
pia, famous for the temple of Ju-
piter Olympius, and the Olympic
games. Epirus was formerlyaking—
dom of Greece, famous for horses.
ln the third Georgick we find Epirus
Eecommcnded as breeding good

orses :

“ Et patriam Epirum referat.

The Phoenicians are thought to have
given this country it's name, from
7⁷:3⁴< abir, which signifies strong;
whence bulls and horses are called
0‘5'28 abirim, being the strongest
of beasts. Thus Epirus will signit'y-
the country of bulas aml lior-scs. It
was certainly famous sor both these
animals.

60. Continuo has leges, ὣς] Af-
ter having observed that nature has
subjected the world to these laws,
that different places should produce
different thing5‚ ever since the time

of Deucalion, he resumes his sub·
ject, aud gives directions when a
rich soil should be plowed, and when
a poor one.

6‘2. Deucalion vacuum lapides, cSo]
The story of Deucalion is in the tirst
book ovaid’s Metamorphosis. We
are there told that, when the world
was destroyed by a ‹leluge, Deuca-
lion only, with his wife Pyrrha, sur-
vived. They consulted the oracle
of Themis, in what manner man-
kind was to be restored. The oraclo
commanded them to throw the bones
of their great mother behind their
backs. By their great mother they
understood the earth to be meant,
and her bones they apprehended to
mean the stones. They obeycd this
command, and the stones which
Deucalion threw became men, and
those which Pyrrha threw became
women. Ovid concludes the fable
with a remark, almost in Virgil's
words;

‘⁶ lnde genus durum sumus, experi-
“ ensque laborum,

“ Et documenta damus, qua simus
‘² origine nati.‘’

64. Primis α mensibus anni] The
proposition α is wanting in the Carn-
bridge manuscript. By these words
he means the same that he did by
