the combs, and erect the atti-
ficial edifices. But the younger
return wearied home, late at
night, with their thighs {aden
with thymo. They seed also
at large on ammes, and hoary
willows, and casia, and glow-
ing saffron, and tat limes, and
deep coloured hyacinths.

(ί Ι think this may be very well ac-

ί( be ridiculous by having their ac-
‘⁶ tions and manners represented on
“ a level with creaturos so superior

177. Cecropiae] The Poet calls
the Bees Cecropias, from Cecrops
king of Attica, where the honey was
famous.

178. Grandaevis oppida curm]
This passage is taken from Aristode,
who observes, that the older Bees
work within doors‚ and thence be-
come more hairy; but that the
younger sort go abroad, and there-
fore are smoother: Τῶν Σὲ μελιτἾῶν
αἶ μὲν ωρεσςότεξαι τὰ εἵσω ἐργάζον-
“r-2⁸7, καὶ &ao-siai εἶσι διαὶ τὸ εἴσω μένειν.

179. Fingere] In one of Dr.
Mead's manuscripts it isfigere.

181. Crura thymo plenae] The
hairiness of the Bees legs serves to re-
tain the juices which they guther
from flowers.

Arbuta] See the notes on book Ι.
ver. 148, and on book ΙΙΙ. ver.

182. Glaucus saliem] See the
note on book ΙΙ. ver. 13.

Cas-iam] See the note on book
II. ver. 213.

Crocumque rubentem] The petal
of the saffron flower is purple, but
the three divisions of the style, which
are the only part in use, are of the
colour of fire.

183. Pinguem tiliam] See the
note on book ΙΙ. ver. 449.

Ferrugineos hyacinthon] There.
are many flowers commonly known
in gardens under the name of Hya-
cinth⁷ but none of them agree with
the description which we find of this
flower among the Poets‚ who repre-
sent it as having the letters A I in-
scribed on it's petals, Thus Mos-
chus, in his epitaph on Bion, calls up·
on the Hyacinth to take more marks

of A I on it's petals τ N*
