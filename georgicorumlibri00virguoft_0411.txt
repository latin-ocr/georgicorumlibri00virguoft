among, the Lombard, and some
other ancient copies. It is exusta in
the Bodleian manuscript, and in se-
vera! of the oldest editions. Heinsius
Α also, and after him Masvicius read
exusta. Ι believe that Virgil wrote
nasta, and that his transcribers have

a altered it to exhausta, imagining it

to be sufficient to say the fens are ex.
bausted, those watry places not being
easily burnt up. But whosoever is
conver-sant in senny countries, must
know that in dry seasons no lands are
more scorched up than the fens. In
- the first Georgick we have

“ Et cum exustus ager morientibus
‘⁶ aestuat herbis.”

This whole 4:326 verse is wanting
ln one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts.

433. Exilia] Pierius saysitisezie't
in the Lombard and Medicean ma.
nuscripts. I find the same reading in
one of the Arundelian and in one of
Dr. Moed’s manuscripts. But exilit

manuscript, which is no inelegant
reading.

435. Ne.] It is nec in one ofthe
Arundelian and in one of Dr Mead’s
manuscripts, and in an old Quarto
edition printed at Paris in 1494.

Deo] It is clivo in the King's, the
Bodleian, me of the Arundelian,
one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts, and
in several of the old editions, In the
other Arundelian copy, it is clivo.

432] In one of the Arundelian
manuscripts, aster this verso follows

Lubrica convolvens sublato pectore
tergo,

which is a repetition of ver. 4226.
there being only &lorica put for
squamea.

The poet now describes the diseasos,
to which sheep are subject.

441. Turpis oves tentat scabies.]
Columella observes, that no animal
is so subject to tho scab as sheep. lle
adds that it usually arises on their
being injured by cold rain or srost3
or aster shcaring, if they are not well
washed, or if they are permitted to
