‘⁵ cer-cix to glaucique should be in a
‘⁶ pare‘nthesis;” but, as his transla-
tion is printed, the parenthesis in-
clzludes only what is said of the co-
our.

By ardua is meant that the colt
carries his head well, not letting it
hang down. Horace has the same
{pithess when he describes a good

orse:

‘⁶ Regibus hic mos est3 ubi equos
‘⁶ mercantur, apertos

“ Inspiciunt: ne si facies, ut saepe,
“ decora

‘⁶ Mollifulta pede est, emptorem in-
‘⁴ ducat hiantem,

‘⁶ Quod pulchrae cluneS, breve quod
‘⁶ caput, ardua cervix.''

80. Argutumque caput] May
translates this short headed, Dryden
slzarp headed, Dr. Trapp his head
acute. I have rendered it his head is
small, which agrees with what Varro
has said: “caput habet non mag-
“ num ;'’ and Columella: “Corpo-
(ἔ ris vero forma constabit exiguo
‘⁶ capite:’' and Palladius: “Pulchri-
“ tudinis partes hae sunt, ut sit exi-
“ guum caput et siccum.’' Horace
commends a short head: “breve quod
‘⁵ caput.'’ .

81. Luxuriatque toris animosum
pectus] The tori are brawny swel-
lings of the muscles. Varro says the
breast should be broad and full:
‘5- pectus latum et plenum.'’
mella says it should be full οἱ brawny

Colu-

swellings of the museles: ‘⁶ muscu-
‘4 lorum toris numeroso pectore.⁷’
Palladius says it should be broad:
“ pectus late patenS.” Virgil's de-
scription of the breast is more ex,
pressive than any other, and he adds
the epithet animosum to shexv that this
luxuriance of brawn in the muscles
denotes the spirit and fire of the
horse. But the translators have un-
happily agreed to leave out this noble
epithet. May has only broad amlfulb
breasted: Dryden only brawny his·
chest, {md deep: and Dr. Trapp his
chest with swellz‘ng knots luxuriant.
82. Slictdeffce3.] It is very difficult
to come to an exact knowledge of
the signification of those words, by
which the ancients expressed their
colours. Spaclix signified a branch of
a palm, as we find it used by Plu-
tarch in the fourth question of the
eighth book of his Symposiacks:
Καί τοι δοκῶ μοι μνημονεύεινμέν τοῖς
ἈτἾικοῖς ἀνεγνωκιὶς ἔναγχος, ὅτι πρῶτος
ἐν Δῆλῳ Θησεὺς α’·γῶνα ποιὲν, α’πέσπασε
κλάδον τοῦ ἷεξοῖἱ φῡῖνικος, ᾗ καὶ Σπάῖῗιξ
ὠνομάσθη. We learn from Aulus
Gellius, that the Dorians called
a branch of a palm pluckt off with
the fruit, Spadix3 and that the
fruits of the palm being of a shining
red, that colour came to be called
phoeniceus and spadix.- “ Phoeni-
‘⁶ Ceus, quem tu Graece φοινικόν
“ dixisti, noster est, et rutilus, et
‘⁶ spadix phoenicei συνώνυμος, qui fac-
‘⁶ tus Graece noster est, exuberan-
“. tiam splendoremque significat ru-‚V
