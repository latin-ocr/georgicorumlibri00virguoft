Iu one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts
this verse begins with nunc instead of
' Huc.

Hz’c.] In one os the Arundelian
manuscripts it is sunt.- LaCerda reads
Jeoec.

Tuis muneribus] Bacchus is said
to have been the inventor of wine.
This gift is ascribed to him at the
beginning of the first Georgick τ

“ Liber et alma Ceres, vestro si mu-

’7. Huc] It is nunc again, in Dr.
Mead’s manuscript. -'

Nudataque musto &c.] This alludes
“ to the custom, frequent even now,
in Italy and other placeS, of treading
out the grapes with their feet. Bac.
chus is represented frequently with·
buskins. Thus we find in Tacitus,
that Silius wore buskins in imitat-ion
of Bacchus: ‘⁵ At Messallina non
‘⁶ alias solutior luxu, adulto autumno,
‘⁴ simulacrum vindemiae per domum
ἕ( celebrat3 urgeri praela, fluere la-
‘⁶ cus, et feminae pellibus accinctae

'⁴‘ Silius hedera vinctu s, gerere cothur-

“ nos, jacere caput, strepente circum

culus also tells us, that Mari< An-
t'nony would have himself be called a
new Father Bacchus, and was car.
ried at Alexandria in a charior, like
Father Bacchus, crowned with ivy,
adorned with a goldes crown, hold-
ing a thyrse, and wearing buskins:
