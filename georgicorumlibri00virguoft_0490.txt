P. VIRGILII MARONIS

Quis dubitet ? nam saepe favos ignotus adedit:
Stellio, et lucifugis congesta cubilia blattis,
Immanisque sedens aliena ad pabula fucus,

Aut asper crabro imparibus se immiscuit armis3 245
Aut dirum tineae genus, aut invisa Minervae

Laxos in foribus suspendit aranea casses.

NOTES.

ξς Give them cut waxe.

But he is certainly to be understood
of taking away the superfluous wax,
lest the empty cells should afford
room for noxious animals. Thus
Columella: (ί Iliginius quidem in eo
‘⁶ libro, quem de apibus scripzltss
‘⁶ Aristomachus, inquit, hoc inodo
“ succurrendum laborantibus existi-
“mat: Primum, ut ornnes vitiosi
‘⁶ favi tollantur, et cibus ex integro
‘⁴ recens ponatur: deinde ut furni-
“ gcntur.''

5242. Ignotus stellio? The stellio
is a small spotted lizard, called also a
szczjst. The Poet calls it ignetur, be-
cause of it’s crceping into holes aud
cornerS.

Admau] Pierius found aclluesilin
the Roman manuscript, which he
takes to he a corrupt reading.

243. Ea] Et is lest out iu some
editions3 but Pierius says itis re-
tained in all the ancient manu-
scripts.

Luc-esuge's blatum] The blatta is
an insect something like a beetle:
some take the coch-roch to be the
blatta. They are called lttcffuch,
because they do not appear byday-
light.

245. Crabra] The hornet is an
insect like a παπ-1), but twice as big.

Imparz‘bus armis] This insect is
too large and strong, sor the Reos to
encounter with it.

Inwnz'sczeit.] In one of Dr. Mead’s
manuscripts it is miscuit.

216. Dirum tz'neoe genus.] Many
read durum: but Pierius found dirum
111 most of the ancient manuscripts.
ln the Kinlg’s, the Bodleian, and in
one of the Arnndelian manuscripts it
is (lurum. But dirum is generally
received. Either of these readings
seems to be good.

The tinea is the moth, that eats
garments and many other things.

Invisa Miner-ece amnem] Arachne,
a Lydian maid, disputed with Mi.-
nerva the preference in wcaving
tapistry. Arachne performed her
work to admiration. But as she had
represented in it the crimes of severat
of the Gods, Minerva in a rage de-
stroyed it: at which Arachne, being
grieved, hanged herself. The God-
dess 111 compassion changed her to a
spider. This fable is related in the
fifth book of Ovid’s Metamorphoses.

Servius and other Grammarians
observe, that we ought to write
araneus, in the masculine gendcr:
bnt both virgil and Ovid use ανα-
nea.
