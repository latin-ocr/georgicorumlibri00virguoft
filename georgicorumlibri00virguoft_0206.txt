Implevere3 tenent oleae, armentaque laeta.

139. Thurq'seris Panchaia pinguis
arenis] Panchaia or Panchoea is· a
country of Arabia felir. See the
note on ver. 57, oftlie first Georgiclt.
'l‘he sands hearing sinuli-incense may
be variously interpreted. lt may
mean, that it is in such plenty, that
it is not only gathered from the trees,
but even found in plenty on the
ground. Thus Grirnoaldns para-
phrases it: “ Neque Panchaia, pars
‘⁶ Arabia? soli subjecta et conse-
“ crata, ubi tanta. thuris affluentia
“ est, ut non solum in arborum cor-
“ ficibus, sed in areis etiam legi
“ queat.” Ι believe arm is an error of
the Press, and that it should be arenis.
It may mean also, a soil producing
{rainl-:incenseV as Ruaeus interprets it z
‘¹ Nec tota Panchaia, dives solo tu-
“ rifero :'’ and Dr. 'l'rapp:

‘⁶' —— Nor Panchaia fat
‘⁶ All 0'er‚ with frankincense-produc-
‘⁴ ing glebe.''

Mr. Β--νή thinks it means, that the
frankincense is in such plenty, that
the country may be said to be dunged
with it:

“ Or all Panchai-‘cs phtius, manur'd
‘⁵ with spicy st01·QS.''

“ The interpretation of the last of

“ these lines (says he) differs from
“ the Connncntators„ but 1 think it
“ is Virgil's sense. He always rises
‘⁴ in his descriptionis. After he has
‘⁴ mentioned groves of eiwons, and
‘⁴ golden sands, Persia and India,
⁴‘ what can be greater than to men-
“ tion a country dunged with spices,
“ and what more proper to bring the
“ digression home to his subject,
“ and to connect it with what fol-
“ lows? But this passage deserves to
‘⁴ be examined more nearly. It is
‘⁶ plain, the sense of it turns upon
“ this word pinguis. Now there are
“ too many places in the Georgicks
‘⁶ to be enumerated, where pinguis
‘⁶ terra, pinguis humus, or pingue so-
“ lum, signifies lands well manure&
“ but where it once implies dives by
“ it’s produce, as Ruaeus and his fol-
“ lowers understand it, 1 have not
‘⁴ been able. to discover.”

140. Hoec loca, &c.] He alludes
to the. story of Jason, who went to
Colchis forthe golden fleece3 where he
conquered the bulls, which breathed
forth fire from their nostrils, and
yoked them to a plough. He also
slew a vast dragon, sowed his teeth in
the ground, and destroyed the so}—
diers, which arose from the dragon's
tecm, like a erop of corn from seed.

143. Bacchi Massicus hamon] Mas-
sicus is the name of a mountain of
Campania, celebrated for wine.
