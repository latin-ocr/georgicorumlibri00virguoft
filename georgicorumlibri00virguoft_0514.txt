let us make a libation to Ocea-
nus. At the same time she
prays to Oceanus, the father os
all things, and to tlie sister
nymphs, of whom a hundred
preserve the graves, a hundred
lhe rivers. 'lhrice she noui-ed
liquid nectar on the buming
tire3 thrice the rising flame
simne up to the top osthe roos.
With which omen being ton-
firmed, she thus began ε There
is a prophet in the Carpathian
gniph of Neptune, blue Pru-
1eu5, who mcasures the grear
sea with fishez, and with his
chariat drawn by twossiegged
horses.

P. VIRGILII MARONIS

Oceano libemus, ait, simul ipsa precatur
Oceanumque patrem rerum, Nymphasque sorores,
Centum quae sylvas, centum qua> flumina servant.
Ter liquido ardentem perfudit nectare Vestam ;

Ter flamma ad summum tecti subjecta reluxit. 385
Omine quo firmans animum, sic incipit ipsa,

Est in Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates,

Caeruleus Proteus, magnum qui piscibus aequor
Etjuncto bipedum curru metitur equorum.

The carclzesz'zem was an oblong sort
os cup, a little flatted about the mid-
dle, and having the handles reaching
from top to bottom.

382. Oceanumque patrem rerum]
This expression is according to the
philosophy of Thales, who was of
opinion, 'that all things were ori-
ginally derived from water. Homer
makes Oceanus the father of all the
gods:

Ὠκεανὸν τε θεαῖν γένεσιν, καὶ μητέία
Τηθύν.

384. Perfudit nectare Vestam]
In one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts it
is perfundit.

Nectar is here used sor wine, as in
the fifth Eclogue:

‘⁶ Vina novum fundam calathis Ar-
“ visia nectar.’‘

The Ancients had two Vestae, one
the mother os saturn, who is the
same with the earth3 and the other

the daughter. of the same deity, who
presides over hearths. See the note
on book I. ver. 498.

387. Carpathio] Carpathus‚now
called Scamanto, is an Island of the
Mediterranean, over against Egypt,
from which the neighbouring sea was
called Carpathian.

388. Proteus] It does not appear
certainly from ancient history, who
this Proteus really was. Homer
makes him an Egyptian. Herodotus
represents him as a king os Egypt.
Some suppose him to have been a
sophist‚ others a tumbler, διε. Sir
Isaac Newt0n‚ finding him to have
been contemporary with Amenophis
or Memnon, takes him to have
been only a viceroy to Amenophis,
and to have governed some part of
the lower Egypt, in his absence.
The Poets however have made him a
sea-god, and servant to Neptune.
This whole sable of Proteus is an imi-
tation os the fourth Odyssey‚ where

Homer represents Menelaus consult· ⁰
ing this deity, by the advice and with -

the assistance of his own daughter
Eidothea. '
