Virgil may allude in the words now
under consideration. But then we
must not translate them with Dry-

rally allowed to be that plant
which is cultivated in gardens, un-
der the name of Acanthus salivas
or Brmzk-zcrsz'ne. Most Botanists
also arc of opinion, that it is the
Acanthus of virgil: but the chief
difficulty is, to shew the reason, why

he calls itflexivz‘menAcanthi. These Ἰ

words seem to express a twining
plant. I believe we must entirely
depend upon a passage of Vitruvius,
for the solution of this difficulty.
This famous author tells us, that a
hasket covered with a tile having
been accidentally placed on the
ground over a root of Accmthzls, the
stalks alid leaves burst forth in the
spring, and spreading themselves on
the outsidc of the basket, were b-ent
back again at the top, by the cor-
ners of the tile. Callimachus, a fa..
mous Architect, happening to pass
by, was ‹lelightcd with the novelty
and bcauty of this appearance, and
being to make some pillars at Co-
rinth, imitated the form of this basket

notbe* a more lively image of the
capital of a. Corinthian pillar, than a
-basket covered with a tile, and sur-
founded by leaves of Brankssursiue,

Amantes littora myrtos] Myrtles
delight in growing near the sea-shore.

Galacum] Gralesus is a river of Ca·

Corycius is the name of the old man
