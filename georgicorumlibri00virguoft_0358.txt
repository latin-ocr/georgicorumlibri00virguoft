In the most northern countries the

Elec· canmi] Servius tells 115, that
Elis 15 a city of Arcadia, where
the chariot-raccs were celebrated:
but it is certain that the Olympio
games were celebrated, not at Elis,
but at Olympia. The Pisaeans, in
whose country Olympia was situated,
had many contentions with the Eleans‚
about the government of the Olympio
games: but at last, the Eleans pree
vailing, the whole country between
Achaia9 Messenia, and Arcadia, came
10 110 called Elis. The reader 11111
find a long, account of this in the
eighth book of Strabo’s Geography,
The plains of Elis therefore are not
the plains about the city of Elis, aa
Servius erroneously imagines, but the
pflalins ‘about Olympia, in the region
υ ¹His.
