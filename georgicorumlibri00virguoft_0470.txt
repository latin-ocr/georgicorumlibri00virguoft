and lay up what they get for
the public use. For some are
employed in getting food, and
‘by agreement labour in the
fields: some within the house
lay tears of daffodils, and tough
glue from the barks os trees,
for the foundations of the
combs3 and then suspend the
tenacious wax: others bring
» up the growing young, the
hope of the nation: others
work the purest honey‚ and
distend their cells with liquid
nectar. There are some to
whose lotis fallen the guarding
of the gates: and these by

P. VIRGILII MARONIS

Experiuntur, et in medium quaesita reponunt.·
Namque aliae victu invigilant, et foedere pacto “
Exercentur agris: pars intra septa domorum ⁴
Narcissi lacrymam, et lentum de cortice gluten 160
Prima favis ponunt fundamina: deinde tenaces
Suspendunt ceras : aliae spem gentis adultos
Educunt foetus ε, aliae purissima mella

Stipant, et liquido distendunt nectare cellas.
Sunt, quibus ad portas cecidit custodia sorti:
Inque vicem speculantur aquas, et nubila eaeli ε

165

Aut onera accipiunt venientum, aut agmine facto
Ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent.
Fervet opus, redolentque thymo fragrantia mella.

NOTES.

157. In mediam] See the note
on book I. ver. 127.

158. Vienna] Victa is here put for
victui.

Pacta] In the King’s manuscript
it is parco.

159. Intra] In one of the Arun-
delian manuscripts it is inter..

Septa.] In one of Dr. Mead’s
manuscripts it is tecta.

160. Narcissiwemmam] Ihave
spoken of the Νανείεειις, in the note
on ver. 122. It has there been ob-
served that the fiowers of Narcissus
or Daffodil form a cup in the middle.
These cups are supposed to eontain
the tears of the youth Narcissus, who
wept to death. To this Milton al..
ludes in his Lycidas 3

‘⁴ Bitl‘ Amaranthus all his beauty
‘⁶ And SthqtfflJ'bdz‘llz'es fill their caps with

‘⁶ tears,
‘⁶ To strcw the laureat berse where
‘⁶ Lycid lies.'’

Lentum cle cortice glutem] Pierias
found lectum in the Lombard and

some other ancient manuscripts.
The same reading is in the King's
manuscript.

165. Portas cecidit] In one of
the Arundelian manuscripts it isper-
tam tendit.

167. Aac onera accipiunt, &e.]
This and the two following lines are
repeated in the first AEneid.

168. Ignavum fucos pecus aproe-
sepibus arcent] The Drones are a
sort of ssces without sting5‚ which do
not assist the others in their labour.
On this accountitis generally thought,
that they are expelled by the labour-
ing Bees. Some ‘affirm that the Drones
are. the males, and that, after the work
of generation is over, they aresdriven ’
froin the hive by these amazous.

Ruaeus rendersfucos, gzcespe55 but
I believe guespes signify ωαψς. The
dromos are called bourdons.

In one of the Arundelian manu.
scripts it is urgent instead of ar-
cent.

169. Thymo] See the note on
ver. 112. .
