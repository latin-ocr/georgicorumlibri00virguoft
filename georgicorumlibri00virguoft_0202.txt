and, if it did not spread :broad
a different smell, it might be
taken for a bay: the leaves are
not shaken on· with any winds:
the flower is very tenacioris:
the Medes chew it for their un-
savoury breatlis,and cure with
it their asthmatiek old men.

P. VIRGILII MARONIS

Et si non alium late jactaret odorem,

Laurus erat: folia haud ullis labentia ventis ε
Flos ad prima tenax: animas et olentia Medi
Ora fovent illo, et senibus medicantur anhelis. 135

Servius reads opprima, which he
says is put adverbially, like Et pede
terram crcbraserit, for crebro. The
Kfflg’s, the Cambridge, and the Bod-
leian manuscripts have ad prima,
which is acknowlcdged also by Hein-
sius.

fovent z'llo.] Grimoaldus refers illo to
the flower: hutit is generally thought
to refer to the fruit. Theophrastus
ascribes this virtue to the fruit : Ἐὰν
’γάξ τις {misticae ἓν τῷ ζωμῷ ’ἢ ἐν ἄλλῳ τιν),
τὸ ἔσωθεν τοῦ μῆλου ἒκπῖεσῃ εἷς τὸ στόμα

Pliny says the Parthians are subject
to a stinking breath‚ on account of
the variety of their food, and their
hard drinking: and that their great
men cure this disorder with the seeds
of Citrons. “Animae leonis virus

author, in another place, speaks of
the Citron, as the most salutary of
exotic fruits‚ and a remedy for poi-

of it to the arbute : he says the fruit.

Theophrastus, but it has an agree-
