NOTESo

Hebrus, That country was famous
for good wines. Ulysses speaks in
commendation of some wine, which
was given him by Maron, the priest
of Apollo at Ismarus:

 

Ἀτὲις bryson* ἀσκὸν ἕχον μέλανος
gavone

'H32'0;, ὅν μοι ἕὲωκε Μάξων Ἐυάνὲεος’

ὑιός
εῙξείνς Ἀπόλλωνος. (ὃς ’Ἴσμαρον σι’μφιξε-
Cinea.

“ T hen took a goat-skin fill’d with
“ precihus wine,

“ The gift of Maron, of Evan-
“ theus' line,

“ 'The priest of Phoebus at th’ Is-
‘⁶ marian shrine.''

Mr. Ρορε.

38. Olea magnum vestire Tabur-
num] Taburnus is a mountain of
, Campania, which was very fruitful
ln olives. It is now called Taburo.

39. Tchae mles, δια] The Poet
having invoked Bacchus, and pro-
posed the subjectos this ssook, now
calls upon his Patron Maecenas, to
give him his assistance. ,

“ This allegor3⁷, says Ruaeus, is
‘⁶ generally thought to allude to the
“ cuque, which opinion is strength-
“ ened by the last verses of this book:

ὅ( Sedjam tempus· equum fumantia
“ solvere colla, ὅτε.

“ but I think that this, and the fol.
“ lowing lines allude to Navigation.
‘⁵ And indeed the verb decurro is
“ used with water : Thus Catullus

“ Ausi sunl vada salmoim decurrere
“ puppi.

‘⁶ And Vix-gil, in the fifth AEneid3

‘⁶ Prona petit maria et pelago decur-
“ rit apert0.”

40. Οιῖσειιε, O famoe merito pars
maxima nostrae] “ In some ancient
“ manuscripts it is nostri .· if this be
“ admitted, we must necessarily read,
“ as some think it should be,

‘4 Odecus, O fama, et merito pars
“ maxima nostri.

“ But in the Medicean, and other
‘⁶ correct copies it is famae ποεῖν-α’.
“ ...... The reading in some copies
‘² is extravagant,

“ 0 Deus, O famoe merito pars
“ maxima noslroe.

‘⁶ Surely it is better to read decue
“ with Horace,

“ O et proest'dc'zcm, ὃ dulce decus
‘⁶ mezcm.'' Pmmcs.

tenta] Several Commentators 53st
