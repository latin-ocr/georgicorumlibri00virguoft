‘³ bris, ad bruma} tempor-af Ibe-
lieve instead of ante diem nonam, we
should read ad diem, nonaum for the
ninth of the calensis of November,
which is the twenty-fourth of Octo-
ber, is exactly one and thirty «lays
after the time, which Columella
fixos for the autumnal equinox: and
from the twenty-fourth of October,
there are just six and sorty. (lays to
the twenty—toiirth of Dece1nbe1·‚wliich
hc rccltons to be the winter solstice:
‘⁴ Nono calendas januarii brumale
“ solstitium, sicut Chaldaei obser-
“ vant.’' According to Pliny the win-
ter solstice is December the twenty-
fifth.
222. Gnosiaque ardentis decedat
stella ceroma] Gnosus is a city >of
Crete, where Minos reigned, the sa-
ther osAriadne, who was carried away
by Theseus, and afterwards deserted
by him in the island of Naxos, where
Bacchus fell in love with her and
married her. At the celebration of
their nuptials‚ all the gods made pre-
scnts to the bride3 and Venus gave
her a crown, which Bacchus trans-
lated into the heavens, and made a
constellation. One of the stars of
this constellation is brighter than the
rest, and rises before the whole con-
stellano„ appears. Thus Columella
rockous the bright star to rise on the
eighth ot' October, and the whole
constellation on the thirteenth or four-
teenth: “ Octavo idus Octobris co-
“ 10113ἱ clara stc—lla moriture-Ter·

“ tio et pridie Idus Octobris corona
“ tota manc exoritur? Pliny tells
us, that, according to Caesar, the
briglit star rises on the eighth of Oc-
tober, and the whole constellation on
the fil‘teenth3 ‘⁶ Octavo Idus Octo-
“ bris Caesari fulgens in corona stella
‘⁴ oritur. idibus corona tota.”
Aratus mentions the crown ofAriadne
being placed in the lieavens by Bac·
clius:

 

Ἀυτοῦ κᾷκεῖνος Γέφανος, τὸν ἀγανὸς ἔθηκε

Σῆμ’ ἔμεναι Animo-cog, ἀποιχομένης Ἀρι·
ddum,

Νῶτῳ ὑποςρέφεται κεκμηκότος &Mnaso

Νότῳ μὲν ςέφανος wamia.

Manilius has mentioned the superior
briglitness of one of these stars.

“ At parte ex alia claro volat orbe
“ corona

“ Luce micans varia, 113111 stella vin-
“ citur una

“ Circulus in medio radians5 quae
‘⁶ proxima fronte

‘⁴ Candidaque ardenti distinguit lu·

“ Gnosia desertae fulgent monumenta
“ ρης-1133.υ

Ι have translated decedat, emerge, be-
cause thc commentators agree„ that
virgil means by that word the helia-
cal rising of the croxvn3 that is, when
the constellation, which before had

been obscur-ed by the superior light*
