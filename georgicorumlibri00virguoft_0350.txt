NOTES.

⁴⁴ Quos ad vecturas item instituen-
‘⁴ (lum, ut inania primum ducant
“a plaustra.” Columella advises, that
they should first draw only a branch
of a trec, with sometimes a weight
added to it, then be put to a cart,
and, when they are quite tame,
to a plough: ⁴⁴ Per haec blandi-
⁴⁴. menta triduo sere mansuescunt,
‘⁴ jugumque quarto die accipiunt, cui
‘⁴ ramus illigatur, et temonis rice
‘⁴ trahitur: interdum et pondus ali-
‘⁴ quod injungitur, ut majore nisu
‘⁴ laboris exploretur patientia, post
‘⁴ ejusmodi experimenta vacuo plo-
⁴⁴ stro subjungendi, et paulatim lon-
‘⁴ gius rum oneribus producendi
‘⁴ sunt. Sic perdomiti mox ad ara-
⁴⁴ trum instituantur, sedin subacto
‘⁴ agro, ne statim difficultatem operis
‘⁴ reformident, neve adhuc tenera
‘⁴ colla dura proscissione terra} con-
‘⁴ tundant.''

171.. Summo vestigia pulvere sig-
metm] These words are used to ex-
press the lightness of the carriasgo,
which the untamed bullocks are sust
put to (lraw. The weight is to be
so inconsiderable, that it will not
cause thern to make deep impressions
in the (lust.

172. Vale‘clo uilem sub pondera]
After they have been tried with
empty carriagvs, they are to bc put
to draw such as are heavy, as we

have seen just now, in the quotation
from Columella.

173. szctos temo trahat wreus
orbes] Pierius found vinctos, in tho
ancient manuscripts, instead ofjmzctos.

Brazcn is frequently used to sig-
nify strong. Dr. Trapp translates
cereus, bound with bross .·

⁴⁴ Thon let the beachen axis, bound
⁴⁴ with brass,

175. Ulvaquce palustrem] ⁴⁴ It
⁴⁴ is.qyl-„r1122z in the Roman manu-
⁴⁴ script: bnt ulvam is generally re-
⁴⁴ ceived.'’ Plenius.

It is not certain what plant is
the ulva of the Ancients: Ihave in-
terpreted it seclge; which is a general
name sor large weeds, that grow in
marsle, and near the banks of ri-
vers. Most writers suppose the ulva
to be much like the alga, or sea-
z:raclc; and that they differ chiefly
in this; that the alga grows in salt
water, and the ulva in fresh. But
this, I think, is certain3 ,that there
is no fresh-water plant, which re-
sembles the sea-wrack, and at the
same time agrees with what the An-
cients have said of their ulva. Caesal-
pinus supposes, and not without rea-

son, that the ulva is the same high
