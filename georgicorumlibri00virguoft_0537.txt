Here Mr. 13-— says the beginning
and ending of the first line are snatch-
ed up like tho motion of that sright-
ful croature; and the immensos orbes
betwixt makes the dreadful circle.
No doubt of it, virgil designed it

storm rours through the line. To
me it sounds whistling. Quas αηῖ.

' mos' Eur' assidue is strong sibilation.

I believe Virgil, in some instances,
designed the sound should answer the
sense3 but not in near so many as
ΜΓ. B——— imagined he did. I shall
mention no more, as I find you have
avoided following him where he is
wrong.
