NOTES.

quoted by Servius, tells us 'that in gratitude slew the Nemeaean or Cleo-

the Circensian games, it was >an.
ciently the custom to send out twen-
ty-fiveanz‘sszcs or matches of chariots
in a day, and that each match con..
sisted of four chariots: that the twen-
ty-fisth match was set out at the
charge of the people, by a collection
made amongst them, and was there-
fore called oerarz'us: and that when
this custom was laid aside, the last
match still retained the name of
aerarz'us, It is likewise to the an-
cient custom of celebrating these
games on the banks of rivers, that
the Poet alludes by the words ad fla-
mma.

19. Cuncta mihi Alpheum linquens,
lucosque DIolorchzZ] The Poet here
prophesies that the games which he
shall institute, in honour of Augus-
⁷tus, will be so famous, that the Greeks
will corneto them, and forsake their
own Olympio and Nemeaean gameS.

Alpheus is the name of a river of
Peloponnesus, arising in Arcadia,
passing through the country of Elis,
and falling into the sea below the
city Olympia, which was famous for
the Olympio gemes, instituted by
Hercules in honour of Jupiter. The

victors at these games were crowned ¹

with wild olive.

nean lion, which infested that coun-
try3 and the Nemeaean games were
therefore instituted in honour of Her-
cules. The victors were crownod
with parsley, or perhaps smallage,

20. Cursibus] Running was one
of the five Olympio games, called
the Pentathlam. The others were
wrestling, leaping, throwing the quoit,
and fighting with the caestus.

Decernet] Pierius says it is de..
certet in the Lombard, and some other
manuscripts. I find decertet in the
King’s, one of the Arundelian, in
both Dr. Mead’s manuscripts3and in
some old printed copies.

The Caestas was com-

posed of leathern thongs fastened to ¹

the hands, and filled with lead and
iron, to add force [and weight to the

blow. Thus Theocritus:
