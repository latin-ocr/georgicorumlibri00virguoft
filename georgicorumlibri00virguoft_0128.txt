P. VIRGILH M A RONIS

Clamoremque ferunt ad littora : cumque marinae*
In sicco ludunt fulicae: notasque paludes
Deserit, atque altam supra volat ardea nubem.

NOTES.

³361. [Uergi] What Virgil says
of the cormorant, Aratus ascribes to
the ἔξωῖῗιξις.

Καὶ δ’ ἅν ἐπὶ ξπρτῖν ὅτ’ Ξρωδιὶς κατὰ κίσ-
μω·

Now ἒῑωᾶιὲς is generally understood
to mean a heron: but La Cerda in-
terprets it a mergus or eormoraut.
It is said to be called ἐρωὲιὸς quasi
ἦλωὸιὲς, because it delights in fenny
place53 but this agrees with the hc.
ron, as wellas with the connotant.
The same author will have the αἴθυιαι
of Aratus to he thescelica of virgil,
because they are so called, as he says,
α fuligine, from 'their blackuess ε
though the οἵιθυια is generally thought
to be the same with the mergus. The
κέπφος of Aratus he takes to be the
heron. For the learned reader's sa-
tisfaetion 1 shall set down what Ara-
tus has said of these sea fowh iinme-
diately after the three verses just now

in the Cambridge and in one of
the Arundelian manuscripts In the
King's‚ the Bodleian,

manuscripts, and in some printed
editions it is umbras. Pierius says
it is umbram 111 the Roman and Me-
