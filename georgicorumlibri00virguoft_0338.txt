NOTES.

‘⁶ semina praebeat futurae stirpi :⁷‘
and Palladius also: ‘⁶ Hoc mense
‘⁶ [Martio] saginati, ac pasti ante
‘⁴ admissarii generosis equabus ad-
‘⁶ mittendi sunt.''

1⁶25. Dixere] It is [lua-ere in the
Cambridge manuscript, and in an
old edition, printed at Venice, in
1482.

126. Pubentes] The King’s, the
Cambridge, the Bodleian, one of the
Arundelian, and both Dr. Mead's
manuscripts have florentes. Most of
the old editions have the same read-
ing. Pierius says it is pubentes iu
some ancient manuscripts3 which
reading is admitted also by Heinsius,
Masvici=1s,Ruaeus, and several other
good editors. La Cerda hasflorentes,
but he thinks pubentes better: ‘⁶ Me-
“ lius legas pubentes, ‘⁶ Nam prata
‘⁶ magis conveniunt, quae delicatis
‘⁶ et mollibus herbis abundant, quam
‘⁶ proceris.⁷' This agrees with what
Columella says of the feeding of
horses, who recommends tender
grass, rather than that which is ripe:
“ Gregibus autem spatiosa et palusu
‘⁴ tria, necnon montana pascua eli-
‘⁴ genda sunt, rigua, nec unquam
(ί εἰσρυῇς-3, racuave magis, quam
‘⁶ stirpibus impedita, frequenter mol-
‘⁴ libus potius quam proceris herbis
‘⁶' abundantia.’'

127. Neqaeat] Pierius says it is

nequeat in the Roman and other most
ancient manuscripts, The King’s,
one of the Arundelian, and one of
Dr. Mead’s manuscripts have nequeant⁴
The same reading is admitted by Paul
Stephens, Schrevelius‚ and several of
the old editors, but nequeat is gene„
rally received.

129. Macte tenuant armenta]
This precept of making the females
lean, is delivered also by the prose
writers. Varro sayshe fed his cows

‘'· cipere.'' Columella says the cows
are sed sparingly, lest too great fat-
ness should make them barren ε
‘⁶ Sed et pabulum circa tempus ad-
‘⁶ missurae subtrahitur foeminis, ne
‘⁶ eas steriles reddat nimia corporis

130. U bi concubitus primos jam nola·
voluptas sollicilul] The Critics are
not agreed about the sense of this
passage. Servius says that the word
nota is put to signify that the mares
had been covered before, because
the first time a young mare is co-
vered she ought not to be leant
‘⁶ Dicendo nota per transitum tetigit
‘⁶ rem ab aliis diligenter expressam.
