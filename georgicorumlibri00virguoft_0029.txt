NOTES.

for-Grimoaldus had interpreted this
passage the same way long before:
“ postremo quam frugalem solertiam
“ ipsis apibus, in congregando, et
custodiendo melle, divina provi-
“ dentia concesserit, explicabo, '¹
But, sor my part, I ‹lo not sec any
reason to reject the common inter-
pretati0n; nor do 1 peret-ive why we
may not interpret this passage. qni
cultus sit habendo pecori ; quanta cxpe-
rientia sit habendis apibus. Besides
it rather seems harsh to ascribe ex-
periencc to Bees, whose prudence‚ as
Ruaeus himself confessos, is non usu
comparata sed ingenita.

Parcis] This epithct is frequent-
ly applied to Bees: thus Aris-totle,
ἐξελαύνουσι, δὲ xxa* ταὶς ἆςγεὲς αἶ μέλι τ’ἶκι,
καὶ τὰς μὴ φειδομέικη and Pliny
Coeterum proeparcoe, et quae alioquin
prodigas atque edaces, non secus ac
pigras, et ignavas proturhent ; and
Maniai. parca laborat apis.

One of Dr. Mead's manuscripts,
instead of parcis, has paucis, which
would make this passage be read
thus;

“ - - · apibus quanta experientia,
paucis
“ Hine canere incipiam.”

But 1 think the common reading
is better.

5. Vos, 85c.] The Poet having
proposed the subject os his work,
proceeds to the imocation os those
{lejtloe’ who preside over rural as-
aurs.

Clarissima mundi Lumina] Some
arc of opinion, that in these words
virgil does not invoke the Suu and
Μυοιι, but only Bacchus and Ceres.
Ruaeus assents to this interpretation,
and gives his reasons why those dei-
ties may deserve such an appellation3
1. Because they are thought to have
discovered, and to preside over the
harvest and vintage: 2. Because by
thern may be understood the Sun and
Moon; for it is proved in Macro-
bius, that the Sun is not only Liber
and Dionysius, but also Jupiter,
Mars, Mvmury, and Hercules, and
that the Moon is Ceres. La Corda
contends with better reason. that the
Sun and Moon are here invoked
distinctly from Bacchus and Ceres:
l. Because these words denote only
the Sun and Moon: Q. Because lead·
ing the year is more properly under-
stood of those which lead the whole
year, than of those which lead only
two parts of it: 3. Because. virgil
seems to imitate varro in this pas·
sage, who invokes the Sun and Moon
distinctly from Bacchus and Ceres:
4. Because Virgil is understood in
this sense by Apuleius.

As it is generally thought that
virgil had Varro's invocation in his

· min‹l; it may not be antiss to place

it herc before the Reader. ‘⁴ Et
