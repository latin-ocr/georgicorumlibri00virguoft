conciude with giving them to 'under-
stand, that there was no truth in
what he had been saying. The trans-
parent gate of horn was that through
which the true shades were seut 3 and
the opake gate of ivory served for
the passage of false visions:

AEncas therefore being a solid body,
and no real shade, was not sent out

at the gate appropriated to true vi-
sionS, but at that through which
false visions, being bodies of a more
dense substance than the true, were

accustomed to pass:

“ His ubi tum natum Anchises una.

Had he been let out at the horn gate,
the whole must have been taken for
a Vz'sz'on, though a true one: but
AEneas being yet a living body, and
no proper inhabitant osthose regions,
had been admitted, before the sepa-
ration of his soul from his body, to
converse with spirits, not in a vision,
but in reality. The opake gate was
therefore the most proper for the pas-
sage of a soul, whilst yet encumbred
with a terrestria} body:
