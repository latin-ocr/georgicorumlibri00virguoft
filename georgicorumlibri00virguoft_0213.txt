NOTES.

But it seems scarce probable‚ that
Virgil would mention the vices of
the people, in this place, where he is
celebrating the praise of Italy. Ι
have followed therefore the general
opinion of the Commentators and
Translators, in rendering malum hard-
slez'p or labour.

V olscos] The Volsci were a war-
like people of Italy, of whom there
is abundant mention in the AEneids.

V erutos] “ Armatos verubus, that
“ is, according to Nonius, armed
“ with short and sharp darts. Lipsius
“ reads,

“ Assuetumque malo Ligurem, Vols-
“ cosque veruto:

“ and verutum and veru is the same:
“ but Ι prefer the common reading,
“ verutos from verit, as scutatos from
“ scutum ; cinctutos from ductus?
Ruffius

The Veru is thought to differ from
the Pilum in the form of it's iron3
which was flat in the latter, but round
in the former3 as it is described in
the seventh AEneid:

“ Et tereti pugnant mucrone, veru-
“ que Sabello.”

And with round pointed Sabine jav'llns

fight.

169. Decios] The Decii were a
famous Roman family, three of
whom, the father, son, and grand-

son, devoted themselves at different
times, for the safety of their coun-=
try: the first in the war with the
Latius, being Consul together with
Manlius Torquatus; the second in
the Tuscan war; and the third in
the war with Pyrrhus.

Marios] There were several
Marii, whereof one was seven times
Consul. Julius Caesar was related
to this family by marriage: where-
fore the Poet makes a compliment to
Augustus by celebrating the Marian
family.

Camillos] Marcus Furius Camil-
lus beat the Gauls out of Rome, af-
ter they had taken the city, and laid
siege to the Capitol. His son Lucius
Furius Camillus also beat the Gauls.

170. Scipiadas duros bello] The
elder Scipio delivered his country
from the invasion of Hannibal, by
transferring the war into Africa3
where he subdued the Carthaginians,
imposed a tribute upon them, and
took hostages. Hence he had the
surname of Africanus, and the ho-
nour of a triumph. The younger
Scipio triumphed for the conclusion
of the third Punic war, by the to-
tal destruction of Carthage. Hence
thoy were called the thunder-bolts

‘of war: thus Virgil, in the sixth

AEneid :

“ — Geminos, duo fulmina belli,
‘⁶ Scipiadas, cladem Libyae.'’
