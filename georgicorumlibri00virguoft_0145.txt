takes to have been put in by way of but observe how judiciously Virgil

paraphrase. I find the same reading
in the Cambridge manuscript.

462. Agat] It is agit in the
King’s manuscript: but agat is cer-
tainly much better.

Quid cogitet humidus Auster] Pie..
rius says that some would fain read
quid cogat et humidus Auster: but
that most of the ancient manuscripts
have cogitat.

465. Ο])ενία.] The Bodleian ma..
nuscript has aperta. Dryden seems
to have read aperta, for he translates
it open mars, But I have not seen
aperta in any other manuscript, or in
any printed edition. In Mr. B—’s
edition, it is operta, and yet he trans-
lates it audaciores ware.

466. Ille etiam, &c.] Havingjust
observed that the sun foretels wars
and tumults, he takes occasion to
mention the prodigious paleness of
the sun after the death of Julius (333.ι
sar. Then he digresses into a beau.
titul account of the other prodigies
which are said to have appeared at
the same time. But tho’ he repre.

takes care to shew that he had not
forgot the subject of his Poem in this
long digression. At the close of it
he introduces a husbandman in future
ages plowing up the field of battle,
and astonisbed at the magnitude of
the bones of those, who had been
there buried.

Servius takes the prodigies here
mentioned t‘o have predicted the
death of Julius Caesar3 and men,
tions a darkness of the sun, which
happened on the sourteenth of March,
being the day before that murder. He
adds that this darkness lasted several
hours: “ Constat autem occiso Cae-

“ muerunt saecula noctem. Ovid
relates these prodigies, as preceding
Caesar’s death, but the greatest part
of them‚ and especially the extraor-
dinary dimness of the sun, are related
by Historians, as happening after that
murder. Servius is generally under-
stood to mean an eclipse in this pas..
