senis the butt dropping down under
the yoak, and the uuhappy sax-mer
leaving the plough iu the middle of
tho field. Hence he slides into a
beautiful digression, eoncerning the
wholesome siniplicity of the foed of
these aniinals, which he opposes to
the luxurious and destructive diet of
mankind. 110 represents tho morta-
