of the mouth of a deity. .

453. Non te nullius] Servius in-
terprets this non humilis sed magni;
but the Nymphs, who were offended
with Aristaeus, were not great dei-
ties: and as for Orpheus and Eury-
dice, they were no deities at all.

454. Magna luis commissa] La
’ Cerda reads lues, and interprets it
nam commissa quidem est magnellum
tuarum apum, deletoeque omnes in-
genti occidione. But luis is general·
ly understood to be a verb, which
seems to be the best interpretation.

Orpheus] He was the son of OEa-
grus, a king, or, according to Servi-
uS, a river of Thrace, by the muse
Calliope. Some will have him to be

· the son of Apollo: but I believe Vir-

g‘il was not of that opinion 3 because,
in* the fourth Eclogue, he derives the,

γ poetical skill of Linus from his father

Apollo, and that of Orpheus from
his mother Calliope:

“ Non me carminibus vincet nec
“ Thracius Orpheus,

‘⁴ Nec Linus: huic mater quamviS,
‘⁶ atque huic pater adsit,

‘4 Orphei Calliopea, Lino formosus

Some refer these words to poenas, in
which sense they are understood by

‘⁴ -=- — — To thee this punishment
‘4 Though not so great as thou de-

Others refer them to miserabilis Or-

And Dr. Trapp:

‘⁶ Orpheus, unhappy by no guilt of
