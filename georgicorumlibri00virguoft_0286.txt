‘4 He sees no poor, whose miserable
‘⁶ state
‘⁶ He suffers sor.’'

Cowley speaks much to the same
purpose in his discourse of Agricul-
ture: ‘⁶ There are as many ways to be
‘⁶ rich, and, which is better, there
“ is no possibility to be poor, with-
(ζ out such negligence as can hare
‘⁶ neither excuse nor pity3 for a little
‘⁴ ground will without question seed
“ a little family, and the superflui-
‘⁶ ties of life, which are now in some
‘⁶ cases by custom made almost ne-
‘⁶ cessary, must be supplied out of
‘⁶ the superabundance ot' art and in-
“ dustry,or contemned by as great a
‘⁶ degree of Philosophy.''

500'. Quos rami fructus, &c.] No
man's memory has been more tra-
duced than that of Epicurus. He
has been represented as a person
wholly given up to luxury and intem-
perance. His name is become a
proverb, to expressa voluptuous per-
son, whose whole pleasure was in
eating and drinking. And yet it is
certain that he was a great pattern
of temperance, and recommended it
to his followerS. Diogenes Laertius
informs us that he was contented
with bread and water, and, when he
had a mind to gratisy his appetite, he
added a piece of cheese. Ἀυτός τέ

curus himself, in his epistle to Menoe-
ceus, says, that when he speaks of
pleasure he does not mean rthe plea-
sures of the voluptuous and intempe-
rate, as some have misinterpreted him:
but tranquillity of mind aud a body
void of pain. Not eating, says he,
and drinking, not venereal enjoy-
ments, not a luxurious table, procure
a pleasant lise, but sober reasoning,
which searches into the causes why
some things are to be chosen, others to
be rejected, and explodes those opi..
nions which tend to disturb the mind:

says his countryman enjoys these
frugal blessings of temperance: he
lives upon the sruits of his own trees,
and what nature produces all around
him. This Cowley calls being a true
Epicure:
