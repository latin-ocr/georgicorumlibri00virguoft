Quos ignis eceli Cyllenius erret in orbes·

In primis venerare Deos, atque annua magnae
Sacra refer Cereri, laetis operatus iu herbis,
Extremae sub casum hyemiS, jain vere sereno. 340.

think Virgil isto bo amierstood to

therehy to predict a storin. That
planet is almost two years aud a half
in passing through each sign: there-
foro surely we arc not to expect a
continuative of the suino wcathor for
so long a timo. I rather think he
means that w<- should observo tho as-
ponis of the plane-ts in gnum-al τ and
mentions Saturn and hiereury for the
whole number. Thus in a former
verso hc mentions Maia, one of tho
Pleiades, for that whole constellation:

337. Ignis Cyllenius] By the

Cyllcnz'an fire lie means Mercury,>

who was said to be born in Cyllene,
a mountain of Arcadia.

Erret] The wmzclerz'ng of a
Planet is a very proper cxpression3
tho word being derived from πλάνη,
zsamlering. 1

338. Annua magme sacra reser'
Gerena] The Post here gives a beau-
tiful description of the Ambarva-
lfa,· so called because the victim was
led round the fields: qnod-uictima ccm-
hdret arva. In ver. 345 Via-gil meu-
tions it being led three times round.

340, Omma] All tileancient ma-
nuscripts which Pierius had seen, ex-
cept the Mmhcezm, have casu. It is
casta also iu tho King's, the Bodleian,
and in both Dr. Mead’s manuscripts.

341. Tam pingues agni, et tum
onollfssizna vinca] Pierius says that·
all {he ancientma-nuscripts he had-seen
agree in reading pingues agni et,
without a Synaloepha, and that some>
have tunc and others tum. Hc ol)-
serves also that in the Medicean copy
it is tunc in this verse, but iu the next
itis Tum somm‘ dulces. In one of·
the Arundelian manuscripts itis Time
pingues agni tum sunt. In one of‘
Dr. Mcad's it is Tum pingues agn-2*
sunt tum. In the other it is 'I'zcm
pingues agni, et [mn.- which reading
is admitted by Heinsius, from whom
T he other, manu-

scripts,

I seldom dev-iate.
