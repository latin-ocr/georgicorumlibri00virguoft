NOTES.

‘⁴ septem jugera non minus industrie
“ coluerit, quam sortiter armis quae.
‘⁴ sierat.. ..At mehercule vera ilia
“ Romuli proles assiduis venatibus,
‘⁶ nec minus agrestibus operibus ex-
“ ercitata‚ firmissimis praevaluit cor-
‘⁶ poribus, ac militiam belli, cum
‘⁶ res postulavit, facile sustinuit, du..
‘⁶ rata pacis laboribus, semperque
“ rusticam piebem praeposuit urba-
“ nae.” Piiny observes that Italy
produced agreater quantity of corn
in former ages, which he ascribes to
the land’s being cultixated by the
hands of genera153 and ploughmen
who had triumphed: ‘⁶ Quaenam ergo
‘⁶ tantae ubertatis causa erat? Ipso-
“ rum tunc manibus Imperatorum
“ colebantur agri, ut fas est credere,
‘⁴ gaudente terra vomere laureato, et
“ triumphali aratore: sive illi eadem
“ eura semina tractabant, qua bella,
“ eademque diligentia arra dispone-
“ bant, qua castra: sive honestis ma-
‘⁶ nibus omnia laetius proveniunt,-
‘4 quoniam et curiosius fiunt.'’

535. Septemth mm sibi muro cir-
cumdedz't arces] In some editions it
is septem qztoe.

‘⁶ The seven hilis of Rome, which
“ were inclosed within one wall,
“ were: the Palatinus7 novs Palclzzo
‘⁴ maggiore;
‘⁶ monte Cavdll05 the Cadius, now
“ monte di S. Giozvmns' Later(z›10;
‘⁴ the Capitolinus„ now Caum-icloglm,
“ the Aventinus, now monte clz' S.
ξ( ,ςαῠίιιιιῑ the Esquilinus, now mon-

the Quirinalis, nOW‘

‘⁶ te dc· S. Maria maggiore; and the
“ Viminalz's; to which seven were
‘⁶ added the Jcmiculus, now ssIonto-
‘⁶ rio, and the Vctte'ccm. Rcfflus.

536. Dictaei Regia] Dicte is the
name ofa mountain of Crete, where
Jupiter was educated, and on which
a temple was built in honour of him.
Hence the Poet calls Jupiter the Dic.
taean king.

537. Ccesisjavencis] In the first:
ages it was thought unlawful to slay
their exeo, because they assisted man..
kind in tilling the ground. Thus
Cicero: Quid de bobus loquar?
‘⁶ quibus cum terrae subigerentur fis-
‘⁴ sione glebarum, ab illo aureo ge..-
‘4 nere⁷ ut Poetae loquuntur, vis

⁷ ‘⁶ nunquam ulla afferebatur-3³ Varro

says it was anciently made a capital
crime to kin an ox: ‘⁶ Hic socius ho-
‘⁴ minum in rustico opere, et Cereris·
‘⁶ minister. Ab hoc antiqui manus ita.
‘⁴ abstineri voluerunt, ut capite sanx-
‘4 erint, siquis occidisset :'’ and Co-
lumella also says that oxen were so
esteemed among the ancients, that
it was held as capital a crime to kill an
ox, as to slay a citizen: “Cujus
‘⁶ tanta suit apud antiquos venerati07
“ ut tam capitale esset bovem ne-
‘⁵ casse, quam civem.'’ virgil seems
in this place to have imitated Aratus,
who says that in the brazen age men
first began to form the mischievous
swerd, and to eat the labouring
oxen z
