NOTES.

‘⁵ lio.‘' He speaks of itin another
place, as a grape in high esteem:
‘⁶ Et Rhaetica in maritimis Alpibus
‘⁴ appellata, dissimilis laudata? illi?
We leam from the same author, that
Tiberius introduced another sort of
wine, but that till then the Rhaetian
was most esteemed: “ Aliis gratiam
‘⁶ qui et vinis fumus affert fabrilis,
“ iisque gloriam praecipuain in for-
“ nacibus Africae Tiberii Caesaris
‘¹ autoritas fecit. Ante eumnhaeticis
‘⁶ prior mensa erat, et uvis Veronen-
“ sium agro.'’ But what has the
most weight with nie in this argu-
ment is, that Suetonius has informed
us, that this wine was the favourite
of Augustus Caesar: “ Maxime de-
“ lectatus est Rhaetico.” Surely Vir-
gil was not so ill a courtier, as ιο
make a doubt whether he should
praise or dispraise that wine which
his Emperor applaucled: though he
confesses at the same time that he
must be so sincere as to prefer the
Falernian wine before it.

96. Nec cellis ideo contende Faler-
nis] Pierius found adeo instead of
ideo, in some ancient manuscripts,
which he thinks more elegant.

Falernus is the name of a moun-
tain of Campania, famous for the best
wine.

97. Sunt etiam Ammineoe vites, fir-
missima vina] One of the Arundelian
manuscripts has sunt et Ammineoe: the
other has sunt et Amineoe. This last
reading is in one of Dr. Mead’s ma-

nuscripts, and is admitted by Servius,

Paul Stephens, La Cerda, and sere-
ral other editors, The Cambridge,
and the other manuscript of Dr.
Mead has sunt et Animee, which is an
easy mistake of the transcribcrs for
Amincce. The old Nurenbmg edition
has suntque Amineoe. Pierius says the
Medicean and Vatican manuscripts
have sunt elium Ammineoe: itis the
same in the King's and the Bodleian
manuscripts. This reading is approved
by Heinsius, Rnaeus, Massicius, and
most of the modern editors. Ami-
neum vinum, says Servius, quasi sine
ηιὶηἰο, ιἰί est, rubore, nam album est,
But this seems to be an iinagination
of his own, not founded on any good
authority.

98. Tmolius adsurgit quibus, et retr
ipse Phameam] Most of the editors
read Tmolus et a‘l-surgit. Some have
Tmolus adsurgit, but this is objected
to by the Grannnarians, because there
is no instance ot' a Hexameter verse
beginning with a Trochee. To avoid
this iinpropriety, perhaps they stuck
in et, for which there is no occasion, ,
if we. read Tmolius, according to the
Medicean, the Vaticam and the King's
manuscripts. 'l'his reading is approved
by Pierius, Heinsius, and Masvicius.
I find it also in several of the oldest
printed editions. Inone of Dr. Mead's
manuscripts it is mollius assurgit. Ι
have. spoken of Tmolus in the note
on ver. 56. of the first book. This
