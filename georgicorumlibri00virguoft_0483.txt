paid by the Medes and Pei-stans to
their monarch.

Poetobserves‚ that somePhilosophers,
considering the great sagae-ity of these
insects, have supposed them to par-
take of the divine mind3 and 1101100
takes occasion to speak of 1110 Pla-
tonic system of a soul auimating the
universe.

At the latter end os the second
book our Poet declares himself an
admirer of Epicuru53 and 111 11115
place he plainly follows the doctrines
of Plato, in which he has been ac-
cused of inconsistency. Butlet itbe
observem that he has not 51101111 him-
selt' attached to the whole Epicurean
Philosophy. The doctrine, os that
Philosophi-r, which Virgil adopts,
is, that happiness cousists 111 a con-
stant tranquillity of miud3 and
that awise man ought to lay aside
the sear of death. lle had iudsed in
his younger days been a more strict

sollower of Epicurus, as we may ga.
ther from the sixth Eclogue. But
perhaps in his riper years he might,
as well as his friend Horace, la)v a-
side some of those doctrines. The
belief of a divine mind governing the
universe, and of a future state, plain-
ly appears iu this Georgick, and iu
the sixth [Encid. lt may be ob-
jected, that hc does not here propose
the Platonic system as his own opi-
nion, because he says only that some
have adranced this doctrine. ssut
then it must be considered, that he
has put the same sentiments in the
mouth of Anchises, 111 1110 Elysian
tields, which 110 would not have
(lone, if he had not thought them to
be true. I know it will be replied,
that 1110 Commentators are almost
unanimousl) of opinion, that virgil
himself* declares what he lias said of
the future state, in the sixth sEneid
to be a fiction, which ho plainly ex.
presses by the passage of AEneas
through the ivory gato. But it seems
improbable, that the l'oet should be-
stow 5011111111 pains iu composing that
siue account of the infernal regions;
should take an opportunity of making
so ‹lelicate a compliment to Augustus
