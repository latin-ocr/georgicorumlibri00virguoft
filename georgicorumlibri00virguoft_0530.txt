would never have celebrated him as
a pattern of modosty and virtue.
Ovid indeed, who was under the
displeasurc of Augustus Caesar, on ac-
count of tho obscenity of his verse5‚
excuses himself by the example of
virgil, who described the flames of
Amaryllis and Philus, and the un-

lawful commerce of AEncas and
Dido:

Had this contemporay Poet known,
aud he could not but have known it

The. Orgies were a mad solemnIty'
sacred to Bacchus, which was cele.
brated with a kind of drunken sury.
The word is derived from ὀργὴ, fury.
It was in one of these drunken fits it
seems, that Orpheus was torn in
preces. ,

grus the Thracian king or river men.
tioned before to be the father of
Orpheus.

525. Eurydicen] The repetition
of the name of Eurydice, in this and
the following verseS, is exceedingly
beautiful.

The rcadcr will not be displeased
perhaps, if I give him the satisfaction
of knowing, that Orpheus soon after
foundhis Eurydice in the happy man-
sions of tho other world, where he
could gaze on her incessantly, with-
out any fear of losing her, as it is
beautifullydescribed by ovid z
