NOTES.

272. Balantumque gregem fluvio
mersare salubri] Columella ob-
serves, upon this passage, that it was
unlawful to wash the sheep on holy
days, for the sake of the wool : but
that it was allowed to wash them, to
cure them of their diseases. Hence
virgil mentions the wholesome river,
to shew that he meant it by way of

'medicinez “ Vetant quoque lana-
“ rum causa lavari oves, nisi propter
“ medicinam. Virgilius, quod liceat
“ feriis flumine abluere gregem,
‘⁶ praecepit, etidcirco adjecit, fluvio
‘⁶ mersare salubri. Sunt enirn vitia,
‘⁶ vquorum causa pecus utile sit la-
“ vare.’' Balantum gregem is here
used for sheep, with great propriety :
sor it is observ-able that sheep make a.
great bleating, when they are washed.

274. Vilibus ponus] Vilis signi-
fies common, metm, or cheap. Po-
mum is used by the Ancients not only
for apples, but for all esculent fruits.
Fruit js used by Botanists to signify
the seeds of any plant, with their co-
vcring: but in common acceptation
it agrees exactly with what the An-
cieuts meant by Pomam. See my
First Lectare os α Course of Bolon y,
page 19, 20, 21.

Lapidem incusum] This Servius

interprets a stone cut with teelh, sor
a hand-mill to grind corn. 'l'hu
King's and the Bodleian manuscript,

and some of the old printed editions
have incussum.

⁶276. Ipsa (lies, Sco] Now the
Poet gives an account of those days,
which were reckoned lucky and un-
lucky by the Ancients.

277. Quintam fagea] The fifth
day is set down as unlucky, by
Hesiod:

279. Coeumque, Iapetumque creat,
scevuquce Typh οέα.] These are said
also by Hesiod, to be the sons of the
earth. virgil imitatas the Greek
Poet in mentioning Coeus and Iape-
tus without any epithet.
