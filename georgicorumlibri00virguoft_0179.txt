NOTES.

‘¹‘ give one example, by following
‘⁶ which any one may ingraft what-
“ soever kind he pleases on any tree.
“ Make a trench four feet every way
“ from an· olive-trec, of such a
‘⁶ length that the extremities of the
“ olive-branches may reach it. Into
‘⁶' this trench put a young fig-tree,
“ and be careful that it be fair and
“ strong. After three or five years,
‘⁴ when it is sufficiently grown, bend
“ down the fairest branch of the
“ olive-tree‚ and bind it to the fig-
“ stock: and so cutting off the* rest
“ of the branches‚ leave only those
‘⁶ which you would ingraft. Then
“ top the fig, smooth the wound, and
‘⁴ cleave the middle of the stock
“ with a wedge. Then shave the
“ ends of the olive brancbes on each
,“ side, whilst they grow to the mo-
“ ther plant, and so fit them to the
“ cleft of the fig, and take out the
“ wedge, and bind them carcfully,
‘² that they may not start back. Thus
“in three years time the fig and
“ olive will unite: and in the fourth
‘⁶ year, when they are well incorpo-
“ rated, cut the olive branches from
“ the mother in the same manner as
“ you cut off layers⁶ By this me-
“ thod every kind of cion isingrafted
‘⁶ upon any tree.’' ,

What I have here quoted is, I
think, sufficient to justify what the
Poet has related. It cannot be ima-
gined, that all he says is from his own
experience: but it was certainly
thought in bis time to be practicable.
I shall now lay before the reader what

may be said on the other side of the

question, in the words of ΜΓ. Miller,
who has done me the favour to com-
municate the following observations.
“The ancients used two different
‘⁶ metnods of grafting: the first is
‘⁶ by approach3 the otheris what the
“ Gardeners term elisi-grafting. It
“ is the former niethod which Colu-
“ mella has described, where he di-
“ rects the stock, on which the grat't
is to be inserted, to be planted so
near the tree designed to be. propa-
gated, as that the branchos may be
‘⁶ drawn down, and inserted in the
‘⁴ stock‚ without being cut from the
“ parent treet for he directs the let· .
“ ting it remain two years before it is
‘⁶ separated. As to the different kinds
‘⁶ of trees, which are mentioned by
“ the Poet. to be ingrasted on each
“ other, Idare affirm it was never
“ practised in any country: so that
“ we must either suppose the trees,
‘⁴ which now pass under the same ap-
“ pellation, to be different from those,
“ known at that time under such
“ names, or that it is a licence taken
“ by the Poet to einbeliish his Poem.
“ What Columtlla has said to con-
“ firm this, is no more than what we
‘⁶ find in most books of husbandry‚
“ both ancient andmodern3 in which
‘⁴ the authors have too frequently
“ spent more time in explaining what
‘⁴ they supposed mysteries‚ than in
“ relating the practice of the most
“ experienced husbandmen. For sup-
“ pose these things were practicable,
“ there could no advantage arise
“ from it to the practitioner, and it
‘⁶ would be only a matter of curio²
