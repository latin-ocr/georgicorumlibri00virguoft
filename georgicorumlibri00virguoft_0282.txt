NOTES

“ -—O! where are the plains‚

‘⁶ sperchius, and Taygeta, by the
‘⁶ dames

‘⁶ lian rage

“ Frequented?›’

437. Sperchias] Sperchius 15 3
famous river of Thessaly rising from
mount Pindus.

Virginibus bacchata Lacoem's Tay-
geta ] Taygetus, 111 the plural number
Taygeta, is a mountain of Laconia
near Sparta: itwas sacred to Bacchn53
and his orgies were celebrated upon
it by the Ι acedaemoniau u omen.

488. 69ἰειίί5 in uallibus Haemi]
Haemus is a mountain of Thrace.
Servius calls it a mountain os Thes-
saly: ‘⁶ Hoemi: montis Thessaliae:
‘⁴ in qua etiam sunt Tempeff' See
the note on ver. 412. of the first
Georgick. It is strange that Dryden
should write

‘⁴ Or list me high to Ilemus hilly

‘⁶ crown,”

for the cool valle'es of [stemus.

In one of Dr. Mead's manuscripts
it is gele‘des convallibus instead of
gelidis in r νἰαἰίιῖ) us.

490. Feta, qui potuit, San] The
Commentators generally understand
this to be a repetition of what 119 had
said before: only that as he had then
given the preference to Philosophy· ,

now he seems to make the Philoso-
pher and 1110 Countryman equa13 for
he pronounces them both happy. I
take. the Poet's meaning to be this.
In the paragraph beginning with Ο
fortunato& 800. 119 had shewn the
happiness of the country life, in op-
position to living in courts and cities.
In the next paragraph, beginning
with me vero, &c, he expressed his
earnest desire to become a Natural
Philosopher3 01, if he could not
attain that, 3 good husbandman. In
the paragraph now under considera-
tion, he shews the happiness of the

-countryman to be like that which

was sought after by the Epicurean
Philosophy. Epicurus was happy in
overcoming all fears, especially the
sear of death: the countryman is
happy in conversing with the rural
deities, in being free from troubles,
and the uneasy passions of the mind.
He lives on the fruits of 1115 own
trees, without being troubled with
contentions‚ or law.. suits.

Rerum cognoscere causam] Epic
0111115 wrote thirty-seven books of
Natural Philosophy, which Diogenes
Laertius says were excellent. Καὶ τω

exhorts his friend to accustom him-
