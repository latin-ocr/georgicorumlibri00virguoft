NOTES.

ἑ( sity, to sec the stock of one kind
‘⁶ supporting atreo of a very diffi»-
“rent one. But all these sorts of
‘⁶ trees have been tried on each other,
“ not only in Euglaud, but also in
“ Italy, and from all the different ex-
’ “ periments which have been made,
“ it is found that uo trees of a diffc-
“ rent kind will take on each other.
“ Iu several books of Gardening and
“ Husbandry, we find directions how
‘⁶ to ingraft one sort of tree on an-
“ other of any kind3 which is to
“ piant the stock near ihe trec from
“ which the cion is to be taken, and
‘⁴ when the stock is sufficiently ront-
“ ed, then you must draw down a
“ young branch of the nee, and in-
⁴‘ sert it into the stock as near the
Α “ ground as possible : then the earth
‘⁶ is ordered to be iaid round the stock
“ above the place where it was graft-
“ ed. In this state they were to re-
“ main until the second or thirdyear‚
“ when they should be cut off from
“the parent-trec. By this metbod
‘›‘ I have known a pear—tree grafted
‘⁸ on a cabbage stalk‚ but the stock
‘⁶ was of no use to the graft: for
“ the cion put out roots whereby it
‘⁶ maintained itself. But these being
“little better thau jugglers tricks,
“ were never practised by persons of
‘⁶ experience.’'

lbid. Horrida] 1t is horrens in
the King‘s, and both Dr. Mead's
manusciipts.

Ruaeus thinks that arbutus has the
epithet horrida, on account of the
sewness of the leaves: 1 rather be-
lieveit is because of the ruggedness ,
of it’s bark. Servius seems to take
it in this sense : “ horrida autem his·
“ pida‚'' says he. The branches also
of the arbute are very unequal, which
the Poct seems to express in the num·-
bers of this verse. Mr. B takes
the arbutus to be oui· crab-trec: and
nux to be the filberd ε

 

“But filberds grast on th’ horrid
‘⁶ crab-tree’s brows.''

70. Sterilcs platani malos gessere
valentes] The Platonas is our ori-
enta! Plane-trec, without all question.
Dionysius the Geographer compares
the form of the Murea, or ancient
Peloponnesus, to the leaves of this
tree, making the footstalk to be the
isthmus, by which it is joined to*
