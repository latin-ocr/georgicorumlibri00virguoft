tit-ui Peneian Tempe,

NOTES.

317. Pastor Aristoeusfl Ι have al-
ready said something of Aristaeus, in
the notes on ver. 14. of the first
Georgick3 but as the sahle of him
takes up so considerablea part of the
fourth, I shall say something more of
him in this place.

It is generally agreed, that he was
the son of Apollo, though Cicero, in
one of his orations against Verres,
makes him the son of Bacchus:
‘⁶ Arislaeus, qui, ut Graeci serunt,
“ Liberz'filius, inventor olei esse di-
(ί citur, una cum Libero patre apud
“illos eodem erat in templo conse-
“ cratus.” And yet Cicero himself,
in his third book cle Natura Deorum,
allows him to be the son of Apollo ε
“ Aristaeus, qui olivae dicitur in-
“ ventor, Apollinis filius.'’ He was
born in Libya, whither Apollo trans-
ported his mother, in order to enjoy

vher, according to Pindar: Νἷυ δ’ εὖ·
ρυλείμων ωότνιεί σοι AiC'v'u δέξεται
εὖκλέκ νύμφαν θώματι-ιν ἐν χωσὲοις
πρόφρων ...... τόθι ττι-κῖόει τέξεται
. . . μίγεν ἓν ’πολυχρύσῳ Aqu‘xg.
He married Autonoe the daughter of
Cadmus, by whom he had Aeteon.
After the death of this son, being in-
formed by the oracle of Apollo, that
he should receive divine honours in
the island Cea, he removed thither,
where, offering sacrifice to Jupiter,
he obtained the ceasing of a plague,
and was therefore honoured by them
as a god after his death. Hc is said
also to have visited Arcadia, Sardi-
nia, Sicily, and Thrace, iu all which
eountries he was adored, for having

taught mankind the uses os oil and
honey, and the manner of curdling
milk. The scene of the fable, as it
is here related by Virgil, is placed in
Thessaly.

Pene'e‘a Tempe.] Tempe, as was
observed in the note on book II. ver.
469, is used hy the Poets to express
any pleasant plain 3 but here the epi-
thet Pene'e'a plainly determines, that
the real Thessaliau Tempe is meant.
The river Peneus rises in Pindus, a.
great mountain, of Thessaly, and
flows through the delightful plains of

the Thessalian Tempe. Thus Ovid:

(ζ Est nemus Haemoniae, praerupta
‘⁶ quod undique claudit

“ Sylva3 vocant Tempe: per quae
“ Peneus ab imo

‘4 Effusus Pindo spumosis volvitur
‘⁴ undis 3

‘⁶ Dejectuque gravi tenues agitantia.
‘⁶ fumos

‘⁶ Nubila conducit, summasque asper.
‘⁶ gine sylvas
