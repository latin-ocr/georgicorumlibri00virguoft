one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts. Pierius
found the same reading in the Ro-
man, the Medicean, the Lombard,
und other very ancient manuscripts.
In the oblongmanuscript he found
Fluctus uti in medio, which he. seems
to 'approvei it is the same in the
King's manuscript. Dr. Mead‘s other
manuscript has fluctus aut in medio,
where aut no doubt is an error of the
‘transcriber for ut. In the Cam-
bridge and Bodleian manuscripts it is
Fluctus utin medio, which reading is
received in almost all the printed
editions. We have almost the same
line iu the serenth slineid:

‘⁶ Fluctus uti primo coepit cum al.
‘⁶ bescere vento.⁷’

This simile seems to be taken froin
the fourth Iliad:

Ὣς δ’ ἔτ’ ἔν ὸῖιγιειλῷ πολυηχέϊ κεῖμαι

”Ofw'l' ἐπασσύτερον ζεφῦρου ὑποκινῆ-

“ As when the wlndS, ascending by
“ degroes,

“ First move the whitening surfarse
ξ( of the seris,

‘⁶ The billows float in order to the
‘⁶ shore.

“ The ware behind rolls on the
‘⁶ ware before,

‘⁶ Till, with the growing storm, the
‘⁴ deeps arise3

“ Foam o'er the rocks, and thunder
‘⁶ to the skins,

“ So to the sight the thick battalions
“ throng

“ Shields iii-g'd on shields, and men
‘⁶ drove men along.’'

238. Longius, ex altoque sinum
trahit] The comma is generally
placed at the end of the preceding
verse, which makes the interpreta-
tion of these words very difficult.
But I think all the difficulty is re-
moved by placing the comma after
longius. Virgil is here comparing
the bull's first preparing himself to
renexv the light, to a wave begin-
ning to whiten and swell, at a great
distance from the shore, in the middle
of the sea. Then as the ware rolls
towards the land, 'with a dreadful
roaring among the rocks, and falls
upon the shore like a huge moun-
tain3 so the bull comes furiously
roaring against his unsuspecting ene.
my, and impetuously rushes upon
him.

Sinum trahit is, Ῐ believe, a sin-

’ gular expression3 andI do not find

it explained by the Commentators.
Sinus usually signifies some sort of
cavity‚ as the bosom osany person, or
a hay: it is used also to signify a
waving lin‹.=‚ like the motion of ‘a

y 3 snake.
