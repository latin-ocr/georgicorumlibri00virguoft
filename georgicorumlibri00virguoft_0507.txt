GEORG. LIB. IV.

Quin age, et ipsa manu felices erue sylvas ε
Fer stabulis inimicum ignem, atque interfice messes z
Ure sata, et validam in vites molire bipennem ;
Tanta meae si te ceperunt taedia laudis.

At mater sonitum thalamo sub fluminis alti

Carpebant, hyali saturo fucata colore :
Drymoque, Xanthoque, Ligeaque, Phyllodoceque,

Sensit: eam circum Milesia vellera Nymphae

But proceed, tmd with you:
own hand root up my happy
groves: set hostile fite to my
stans, and dest oy my han-ests:
burn down my plantations, and
exercise a strong bill against
my vines3 if yon have taken
such great offence at my praise-
But his mother heard the voice
under the bed of the deep ri-
ver: the Nymphs were carding
the Milesian wool, died with a

NOTES.

331. Bipetznem] The bipennis is which are not warranted either by

a sort of bill with two edgCS.

334. Sensit] Pierius found sen-
tit in some ancient manuscripts.

Milesia vellera] See the note on
book III. ver. 306. · ’

335. Hyaila] This colonris asea-
green, or glass colom, ὕαλος signify-
ing gloss.

336. Drymoqae, δῖα] The Poets
seem fond of making long catalogues
of nymphs3 as may be seen in He-
siod, Homer, and others.

Ruaeus gives the following etymo-
logy of their names: Drymo from
δρόμος, a. wood of oaks3 Xantho
from ξανθῆ, yellow or golden ε Ligea.
from λίγεια, canorous: Phyllodoce
from φύλλον, a leaf, and δέχομαι, I
take3 Nesaee from νῆσος, an island3
Spio from σπεῖον, a den3 Thalia
from θάλλω, I flourish: Cymodoce
from κόμα, a wave‚ and δέχομαι,
1 tak03 Cydip e from κῦδος, glory,
and ἵππος, a orse3 Lycorias from
λύκος, a wolf: Clio from κλείω, Ι
praise3 Ephyre from φόρω, Ι water3
Opis from ὂψ, ὖπος a countenance3
De'iopea from ἒῆῖος, ardent, and ὂψ,
Ζπος, a voice. Dryden has added
epithets to several of these names,

the original, or their etymologies ι

‘⁴ {3ch wath-f Drymo brown, and
lant e az'r.
“ And sweet Phyllodoce.
“ Opis the meelc, and Deiopeiae
‘4 proud, ⁴
‘⁵ Nisea loftgs.
‘⁶ Thalia joyous, Ephyre the sad.’¹

Grimoaldus has given a large para-
phrase οη all these names which it
may not be amiss to translate:
“ In the first place Drym0‚ so cal-
“ led from a grove of naks. Then
“ Xantho, named either from al
“ yellow colour, or from a river of
“ Troy of the same name, which is
“ called also Scamander. After..
“ wards Ligea, who had her name
“ from the sound os flowing waters,
“ or from a trec οι· herb, called by
“ the Greeks Ligeon. 'rhen Phyl-
“ lodoce, so called from receiving
‘⁶ leaves. And Nesaea, who had
“her name either from spinning,
‘⁶ swimming‚ or washing. Speio
“ also, so called from dens and ca-
“ verns of rivers. Thalia also,
“ named from groenness, joy, and

‘² mitth.
