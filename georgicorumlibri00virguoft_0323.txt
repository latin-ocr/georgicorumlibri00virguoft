85. Golden-tumque premens volvit

sub naribus ignem] It is fremens
instead of premens in the *Cambridge
manuscript. Pierius says it has been
altered to fremens in the Medicean
copy, but it was premens before, as
he finds it also in other copies which
he looks upon to be the most cor-
rect.
“ Wide nostrils and frequent snort-
ings are great signs of mettlein a
horse. Thus it is expressed in the
book of J0b; ‘⁶ 'she glory of his
‘⁶ nostrils is terrible.'' Varro says
the nostrils should not be narrow:
Colu-
inella says they should be open: ⁶⁶ na-
‘⁶ ribus apertis:'’ with which Palla-
dius also agrees, who says, ⁶⁶ naribus
‘⁶ patulis.”

86. Densa jecba, εἰ dextro jactata
recumbit 2¹72 amna] Thus Varro:
‘⁶ Non angusta juba, crebra, fusca,
⁶⁶ subcrispa, subtenuibus setis impli-
“ cata in dexteriorem partem cer-
‘⁶ vicis:'’ and Columella: ⁶⁶ Densa
⁶⁶ juba, et per dextram partem pro.
‘⁶ fusa.” ’

87. Duplex spinea] In ahorse,
{hat is in good case, the back is
broad, and the spine does not stick
up like a ridge, *but forms a kind
of furrow on the back. This seems
to be what is meant by duplex spina,

which is also mentioned by Varr02
⁶⁶ Spina maxime duplici, sin minus
⁶⁶ nou extanti:” and by Columella:
⁶⁶ Spina duplici.'’

88. Souna] It is quatit in the
Roman manuscript, according to
Pierius³

89. Talis Amycloez' domitus Pollu-
cis habenis Cyllarus] Amyclae was
a city of Laconia, where Castor and
Pollux were educated.

Servius thinks that Pollux is put
here for Castor, by a poetical li.
cence. Pollux being famous sor fight-
ing with the cestus, not for the ma.
nagement of horses, which was Cas.
tor's province. Most of the Com-
mentators give up this passage as a
slip of the Poet's memory, Pollux
being allowed to be the horseman by
the general consent of antiquity..
Thus Homer in the eleventh Odyssey ε
