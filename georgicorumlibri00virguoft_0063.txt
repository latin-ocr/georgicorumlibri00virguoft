Ut varias usus meditando extunderet artes

Ut silicis venis abstrusum excuderet ignem.
Tunc alnos primum fluvii sensere cavatas:
Navita tum stellis numeros et nomina feeit,
Pleiadas, Hyadas, claramque Lycaonis Arcton.

were rivers of milk and nine in the
golden age. Thus Ovid:

‘⁸ Flumina jam lactis jam flumina
“ nectaris ibant.'’

133. Ua] Itis etin the Bodleian,
and in one of Dr. Moad's manuscripts.
Ut is certainly right.

Extunderet] Pierius says it is er-
cuderet iu several antient manuscripts:
but in the Roman, the Medicean, and
other good copies, it is extunderet.
The King’s, one off the Axuudeliau,
and one of Dr. Mead's manuscripts
have excuderet.- in the Bodleian it is
effoderet. Eoetmzderet is admitted by
most of the editors.

135. Ut.] So Ι find it in the Carn-
bridge, and one os Dr. Mead’s manu-
scripts. Pierius says it is ut in all
the antient copies he had seen. Ser-
vius, Heinsius‚some of the old printed
editions, and Masvicius read ut. In
most of the modern editions it is et.

136. Aluos] The alder-tree ‹le-
rights in moist places, and on the
banks of rivers. One of these trees
that was grown hollow with age,
falling into a river, may be imagined
to have given the first hint towards
navigation. -

137. Tum] In the old Nurenberg
edition, it is dum.

Lycaonis Arctoa] This line seems to
be an imitation ot' llesiod ;

Πληϊάὲες 9, ιὙάδες τε, τό, τε &Se-a&

Or of Homer

Πληϊάδας θ’, ’Ὑάδας τε, τί, τε σθένος
Ὠρίωνος.

’Ἄρκτον θ’, ἦν καὶ ἄμαξαν ἐπίκλησιι

The Pleiades are seven stars in the
neck of the buil, not in the tall, as
we find in Pliny, lib. 2. cap. 41. “Iu
‘⁴ cauda tauri septem, quas appr-lla-
“ vere vergilias.” They are sabled
to have been the seven daughters os
Atlas, king of Mauritania, whence
they are called also by Virgil Allan-
tides. The Latin writers generally
call them Vergiliae, srom their rising
about the, vernal equinox. Plciades is
generally thought to be derived from
πλέω, to sais, because their rising
pointed out the time in those (lays
proper to adventure to sea. Others
‹lerive this name from ωλέιονες, many,
because they appear in a cluster3 thus
we find Manilius call them sidus glo-
onerabilc. The. Hyades are seven siars
