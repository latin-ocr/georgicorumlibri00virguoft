GEORG. LIB. IV.

Neu propius tectis taxum sine, neve rubentes
Ure foco cancros, altae neu crede paludi3

Aut ubi odor coeni gravis, aut ubi concava pulsu
Saxa sonant, vocisque offensa resultat imago.
Quod superest, nbi pulsam hyemem sol aureus egit
Sub terras, caelumque aestiva luce reclusit3

Illae continuo saltus sylvasque peragrant,

And do not suffera γαν trec
near their musea, nor burn
reddening cmbs in the fire: nor
trust thern near a deep sen. or
where there is a strong smell os
mud, or where the hoilnw rocks
remanet, and return the image
osyourvoice. Moreover, when
the golden sun has driven the
winter under ground, and has
opened the navens with sum-
mer light; they immediately
war-der over the lawa· and

NOTES.

ther: α Et quamvis porticu protec-
“ tet vasa, nihilo minus congestu
ζ( culmorum, et frondium superte-
“ gemus² quantumque res patietur,
‘⁴ a. frigore et tempestatibus munie-
(ί mus.”

47. Tamum] The yew has al-
ways been accounted poisonous. See
the note on book 11. ver. 257.

In the ninth Eclogue the Poet men-
tions the yews of Corsica, as parti-
cularly injurious to Bees:

‘⁶ Sic‘tua Cyrnaeas fugiant examina
taxos.’‘

It does not appear from other writers,
that Corsica abounded in yews ε but
the honey os thatisland was insamous
sor its evil qualities.

Neve rubentes ure foco cancrosu]
It is well known that crabs, lobsters,
ὅτε. are turned red bytho fire. lt
was customary among the Romans
to burn crabs to ashes, which were
esteemed a good remedy for burns
and scalds. '

48. Altae neu crede paludi] In
sens there are no stones sor the Bees
to rest upon: hence it appears that
such places must be very dangerous
to these insects.

49. Uos odor coeni gravis] Ill

smclls are esteemed very pernicious
to Bees : and none can be more of-
sensive than that of stinking mud.

50. V ocisque.] In the old N uren·
berg edition it is vocique.

51. Quod superest, &c.] This pas·
sage relates to the swarming of Bees,
and the manner of making them
settle.

Ubi pulsam hyemem, &c.] The
time of the Bees going abroad ac-
cording to Higinius, as hc is quoted
by Columella, is after the verna!
equinox : ‘⁶ Nam ab aequinoctio ver-
“ no sine cunctatione, jam passim
‘⁴ vagantur, et idoneos ad foetum
“ decerpunt ssoreS.’' 'therefore by
w'mtcr’s being driven away, and the
heavcns being opened by summer
light, we must understand the Poet
to mean that time, when the spring
is so sar advanced, that the Becs are
no longer in danger from eald wea-
ther.

book Ill. ver. 75.

Peragrant.] lt is pererrant in
the old Paris edition in quarto, printed
in 1498.

Purpureosflorffl] I have alrea-⁴
dy obsera-cd, that purple is frequently
used by the Pocts to express any gay
bright colour.
