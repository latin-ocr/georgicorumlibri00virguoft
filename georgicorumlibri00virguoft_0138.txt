Some take this bird to be a Lark3
others think it is a solitar-y bird, with
a purple erest on it's head, which con-
tinually haunts the rocks, and shores
of rhe sea.

with Heinsius, and most of the good
editors. Pierius says it is inter se
in foliis, in the Medic-‚ean and most of
the ancient manuscripts. The pre-
position ἱη is retained also in one of

manuscripts : but in the rest, which I
have consusted, in is omitted. Itis
more agreeable to ‘Virgil's style to
leave it out.

415. Haud equidem credo, cesa]
Here virgil speaks as an Epicurean :
he does not allow any divine know-
ledge or foresight to be in birds; but
jusfly ascribes these changes in their
behaviour to the effccts which the
