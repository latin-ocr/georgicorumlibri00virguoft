458. O fortunatos, &a ] The Poet,
having just mentioned a scene of wat
and confusion, chancres the subject to
a w onderfully beautiful description of
the innocent and peaceful pleasures of
a country life. He begins with shew-
ing, that the pomp and splendor of
courts and cities are neither to be met
with in the country, nor in them-⁴
selves desirable. He then proceeds
to mention the real satisfactions
which are to be found in the country:
quiet, intcgrit) , plenty, diversions,
exercise, piety, and religion.
