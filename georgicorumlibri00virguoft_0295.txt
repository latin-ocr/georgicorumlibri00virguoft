N OTES.

l. Te quoque, &c.] The poet, in-
tending to make cattle the subject of
his third book, unfolds his design, by
saying he will sing of Pales, the god-
dess of Shepherds, of Apollo, who sed
the herds of Admetus on the banks of
Amphrysus, and of the woods and
rivers of Lycaeus, a mountain of Ar-
mdia, famous for sheep. He then
shews a contempt of the fabulous
Poems, the subjects of which he says
are all trite and vulgar, and hopes to
soar above the Greek Poets.

Pales is the goddess of shepherds.
The feast called, Ραίὶῐῖιι, in which

milk was offered to her, was cele-
brated on the twentieth of April, on
which day also Rome was founded by
Romulus.

2. Pastor ubA122phryso.] Amphry-
sus is a river of Thessaly, where A-
pollo fed the herds of king Admetus.

Lycaei] Lycaeus is a mountain
of Arcadia, famous for sheep, and
sacred to Pan, being accounted one ⁷

‘of his habitations.
