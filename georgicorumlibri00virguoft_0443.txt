Seu lento fuerint alvearia vimine texta,

Angustos habeant aditus, nam frigore mella
Cogit hyems, eademque calor liquefacta remittit.
Utraque vis apibus pariter metuenda: neque iilae
Nequicquam in tectis certatim tenuia cera

or os bending twigs inter-woven,
let them have narrow en-
trances3 for winter coagulates
the honey with cold, and beat
melts and dissolves it. The
force of both these is equally
dangerous to the Bees, nor is
it in vain that they diligently
smear the small chinks in their
houses with wax,

NOTES.

‘f e quibus commode vasa texuntur.'’
Varro says t'nat those Bechires,
which are made of Cork are the best:
“ Optimae siunt corticem, deterri-
“ mae fictiles, quod et frigore hyeme,
“ et aestate calore vehementissime hic
‘⁶ commoventur.''
34. Lento vimina] Columella
having mentioned the excellence os
Beehives made of cork or ferula, as
he was just now quoted, adds, that
’ the next in goodncss are those made of
basket-work3 but if neither of these
are conveniently to be had, he re-
commends timber hollowed, or cut
into planks3 and agrees with Varro,
that those. made of earthen ware are
the worst, because they are too ob-
noxious to the extremities of heat and
cold: “ Si neutrum aderit, opere tex-
“ torio salicibus connectuntur: vel
“ si nec haec suppetent, ligno cavata}
‘⁶ arboris, aut in tabulas deseeiae fa.
“ bricabuntur. Deterrima est con-
“ ditio fictilium, qua: et accendun-
“ tur aestatis vaporibus, et gelantur
‘⁴ hyemis frigoribus.'’ Varro also
mentions ΞΠ these soris: ‘'- Alii fa'-
“ ciunt ex viminibus rutundas3 alii
“ e ligno ac corticibus, alii ex arbore
‘⁶ cava, alii fictiles, alii etiam ex se-
‘⁶ ruiis quadratas, longas pedes circi-
“ ter ternos, latas pedem, scd ita uti
‘⁶ cum parum sit qua compleant, eas
‘⁶ coangustent, ne iu vasto loco et
‘⁶ inanidespondeant animum.'’ Vir.

gil mentions only eork and baskeffl
work, the firstof which is undoubted-
ly the best, though not used in Enga
lancha-*here it is less plentiful than in
Italy, which abounds with cork-trees.

35. Angustos habeant aditus]
Thus also Varro: ‘⁴ Media alvo, in¹
‘4 quaintroeantapes, fuciunt forami-
a: na parva, dextra ac sinistra;’' and
Columella: ‘⁶ Foramina, quibus exi-
“ tus aut introitus (latur, angustissi-
(ί rna esse debr-mv

37. Unaque vis apibus pariler me-
tuenda] 'she extremes of heat and
cold are injurious to Reos, as we have
seen in some of the preceding notes,
where the earthcn hives are men-
tioned. Varro also observes that the
greatest care must be taken, lest the
Deos should be destroyed by heat or
eald: ‘⁴ providendum vehementer,
‘⁴ ne propter aesrum aut propter sri-
“ gns ‹lispereant.''

38. Cera spiramenta linunt] The
cera or :cce-⁷: is properly that substance
of which the hone), conii) is formed.
Thus 'Varro ε ‘⁴ favus est, quem
“ lingunt multicaratum e cera, cum
‘⁶ singula cava sena latera habeant,
‘⁶ quot singulis pedes dedit natura.”
The propolis· or hee-bremt is a gluti-
nous substance, which is found about
the door os the hives 3 ‘4 De his
