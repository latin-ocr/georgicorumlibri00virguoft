Thus we find he speaks of Emathia,
Thessaly, Haemus, Pharsalus, and
Philippi, 33 being in the same country.
Florus also, the Historian, speaks
of Thessaly, and the plains of Phi-
lippi, as the same place: ‘⁶ Sic prae-
“ cipitantibus fatis, praelio sumta est
“ Thessalia, et Philippicis campis,
“ urbis, imperii, generis humani fata
‘⁶ commissa sunt.” Perhaps both
Pliny and Servius are in the right, of
whom the former, as has been al..
ready observed, says Macedon was
anciently called Emathia, and the
latter says the same of Thessaly: for
it is not impossible that Macedon,
Thessaly, and Epirus might have
been anciently included under the
name of Emathia. And indeed it
appears from Caesar‘s own account
of that war, that it extended over all
those countries. Soon after Caesar
was come into Greece we find all
Epirus submitting to him, and the
two armies encamped between Dyr-

' rhachium and Apollonia, with the

river Apsus between the two camps.
There are several sharp engagements
in the neighbourhood of Dyrrha-
chium. After his defeat there,
he marches to the river Genusus,
where there was a skirmish between
Caesar’ s horse, and those of Pompey,
who pursued him. We find Domi-
tius marching as sar as Heraclea Sen-
tica, which is in the sarther part of
Macedon, towards Thrace, whence,

being closely pursued by Pompey, he
narrowly escaped, and joined Caesar
at AEginium, on the borders of Thes-
saly. Presently after Caesar besieges
Gomphi, a city of Thessaly, near

'EpiruS, and soon subdues all Thes-

saly ,except the city ot' Larissa, which
was poss scssed by Scipio’ s army Pom-
pey in a few days marches into Thes-
saly, and joins his army with that of
Scipio. After the famous battle of
Pharsalia, in Thessaly, we find Cae.
sar pursuing Pompey, as far as Am-
phipolis, a city of Macedon, in the
confines of Thrace, not far from Phi-
lippi. Thus we sce the war was not
confined to Thessaly, but spread itself
all over Epirus and Macedon, even to
the borders of Thrace: so that the
two wars may, with some latitude,
be ascribed to the same country3
tho’ there was so large a space be-
tween the two spots, where they were
decided.
