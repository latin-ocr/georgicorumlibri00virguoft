NOTES. ι

The sun ne'er views th’uncomfortable
scats,

When radiant he advances, or re.
treats:

Unhappy race! whom enclless night
invades,

Clouzls the dull air, and wraps them
round in shacles.

The habitation of the Cimmerians
was near the Bosphorus, to the north-
, west, being part of the country here
It cannot be
imagined however, that Homer, in
Δ the passage just now cited, supposes
that Ulysses sailed in one day from
the island of Circe to the Bosphorus.
‚It is more probable that he means
the people mentioned by Ephorus, as
he is quoted hy Strabo, who were
. said to have their habitation near the
lake- Avernus, under ground, where
they lived all the (lay long, without
seeing the sun, not coming up till
after sun-set. They conducted those
who came to consult the infernal
oraclo, being a sort of priests to the
Manes. Kal τοῦτο χωρίον Πλουτώ-

359. Oceani rubro oequore.] The
wav es of the ocean seem to be called
red m this place, on account of the
reflection of the setting sun. It1s
however very frequent amongst the
poets, to call the sea purple. Thus
also our Poet, in the fourth Geor-
gick:

‘² Eridanus, quo non alius per pin.
(ί guia culta

“ In mare purpureum violentior in.-
“ ssuit amnis.”

Cicero, in a fragment of the second
book of Academicks, preserved by
Nonius, describes the waves of the
sea as growing purple, when it is cut
by oars: “⁴ Quid? mare nonne cae-
‘⁶ ruleum? at ejus unda, cum est
‘⁶ pulsa remis, pzc771u1·ccscil.'’ In the
fourth book, hc mentions the sca as
being purple on the blowing of Fa-
vonius: ι’· Mare illud quidem, nunc
“ Favonio nascente, purpureum vi-
“⁷ dature*
