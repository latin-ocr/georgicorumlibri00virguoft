thymum,

In the passage now under our con-
sideration, it seems to be mentioned
as a vulgar herb. For otherwise the
Poet, speaking of a hungry gravelly
soil, would hardly have said, that it
was so far from being fit for corn,
that it can hardly afford a little Casia
for the bees. Had he meant the aro-
matic Casia, he would 'never have
let slip such an opportunity of telling
us the advantages of such a soil: that

tho' indeed it was not fit for corn,
yet it might glory in producing the
sweet Casia of Arabia, and pessum*-
ing the air of Italy with Panchaean
odom-s. The Casia therefore here
spoken of must be seme common
well known herb. Nor is it at all to
be wondered at, that the Poet should
speak of two different things under
the same name. We have seen al-
ready, that there are both trees and
herbs called lotus and acanthus. The
Romans frequently made. use ot'Greek
names, to express different, platus,
which were common in their own
country, and afterwards confounded
the descriptions of both together. It
may not. be amiss also to observe
that we have a spice, and also a
common flower, both which we call
cloves3 and that we have a common
herb in our garriens, which we call
balm of Gilead; tho’ very different:
from the trec, which affords that
precious baham. It has been sup-
possed by some that our Lavencler is
the Casia, which virgi! means in this
place: but on diligently comparing
'I'tieopt11-asttts‚ Pliny, and Dioscorides,
it will appear to be a very different:
plant. Pliny tells us. that the coro-
nary Casia is the same with what
the Greeks call Cneoron: ‘⁴ Sunt et
