Phocis, sacred to Apollo and the
Near it was the city Delphi,
famous sor the temple and oracle of
the Pythian Apollo. At the foot of
Castalian
spring, sacred to the Muses·

293. Devertitur] In many co-
pies itis devertitur: but Pierius says
it is divertitur in all the ancient ma.
nuscripts which he has seen.

Molli oliva] Clivus is used both

> for the ascent and descent of ahill.

Servius understands it in this place to

Χ signify a (lescent .· “ facili itinere et

“ descensionem This interpretation
seems to agree best with Virgil’s
sense3 sor he speaks of passing over
the mountain3 and therefore he must
descend again, to corne to the Ca-
stalian spring. Grimoaldus however
takes it to mean an uacent.- ‘⁶ per

‘f quae nemo veterum Poetarum fa.
‘⁶ cili ascensu trajicere potuit hacte-
“ nuS. Of the same opinion is La
Cerda: ‘⁶ Est Castalius fons Mu..
‘⁶ sarum, non in ipso vertice Parnassi,
“ sed ad ima, ideo tanturn per mol-
‘⁶ lem quendam clivum ascensus est
“ ad illum.’' Dr. Trapp follows this
interpretation :

 

By sost ascend

‘⁶ Inclining to the pure Castalian
‘⁶ stream.''

We find an expression like this in
the ninth Eclogue: ν

Qua se subducere colles

‘⁶ Incipiunt, mollique jugum demitte-
“ re clivo,

‘⁶ Usque ad aquam, et veteris jam
“ fracta cacumina fagi.’'

Here molli clivo plainly signifies an
easy clescent,· and thus it is understood
by La Cerda himself: ‘⁶ A cliro
“ quopiam molli leniterque subducto
⁶⁶ usque ad aquam Mincii fluminis,
‘⁶ et fagum, cui prae senio fracta ca-
“ cumina.” Thus also Dr. Trapp
translates this passage z

‘⁶ NVhere the hills begin

‘⁶ To lessen by an easy soft (iescam,

‘⁶ Down to the water, and the
“ stunted beech.”

 

294. Pales] See the note on
ver. 1.

Sonamlum] It is canendum in
one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts.

295. Incipiens, δια] In this pas-
sage the Poet treats of the care of
sheep and goats, during the winter
season.

Stabulis in mollibus] Servius in-
terprets mollibus oearm: ⁶⁶ clemen-
“ tioribus et aeris temperati3 vel
“ propter plagam australem, vel
‘⁶ propter suppositas herbas animali.

“ bus.'’ In this he is followedby
Dr. Trapp:

“ First, I ordain, that in warm huts
‘⁶ the sheep
‘⁶ Be fodder’d.”
