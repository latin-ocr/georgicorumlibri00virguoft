GEORG. LlB. Ῑ.

Dejicit: ingeminant austri, et densissimus imber:
Nunc nemora ingenti vento, nunc littora plangunt.
Hoc metuens, caeli menses et sydera serva:

Fiigida Saturni sese quo stella receptet:

the south winds redouble ι and
the shov.-erthickens exceed'mg-
ly: now the wonds, and now
the shores resound with the
335 vast wind. ln sear of this, ob-

δεῖτε the monthly signs, and
the constellations : obser-ve xv hi,
ther the cold planet os saturn

NOTES.

ἔθεος is generally ἐέὲω, though some-
times it is ἁθων. Theocritus has ⁶232,
in a verse of the seventh Idyllium,
which virgil is thought in this place
to have imitated z

Ἠ ’ᾈὲω, ἦ εΡοὲὅπ-εὶιν, ἦ Καύκασον {674oe-
τόεντα-

Athos is a mountain of Macedonia,
making a sort os Peninsula in the AE-
gean sea, or Archipelago.

Rhodopen] Rhodope is a moun-
mimos Thrace.

Alta Ceraunia] The Ceraunia
are some high mountains in Epirus,
βο called because they are frequently
stricken with thunder: for κεραυνὸς
signifies a thunderbolt.

333. Demissimus imber] One
of Dr. Mead⁷s manuscripts has den-
sissima-S oether.

334. Plangzcnt.] Servius reads
plangit, and interprets it resonare
facilz but he acknowledges that others
read plangunt. Pierius says it is
’ plangit in the Roman and some other
very ancient manuscripts3 and seems
to suppose densissimus imber to be
the nominative case to plangit.. If
this interpretation be admitted, we
must render the passage now under
consideration thus: ⁶ ί The south winds
‘⁴ redouble3 and the exceeding thick
‘⁶ shower now makes the woodS, and
‘⁶ now the shores resound.” He
adds ‘⁴ that in the Medicean copy
‘⁶ plangunt is paraphrased scindant.-

(ζ thus the verb must agree both with
‘⁶ aus-ter and imber.’' But to say either
that the slzozcer, or the sozlth :sind
and the slzozcer make the woods and
shores resound with a great wind,
seems to me to be a tautology. If
we were to admit plangit, Ι should
rather with ΜΓ. Β , understand
Jupiter: though I think he is mis-
taken in ascribing this interpretation
to Pierius. Masvicius also has ad-
mitted plangit: but as plangunt
seems to be full as good as the other
reading, and as it is generally re-
ceived, I have chosen to adhere to it.

335. Hoc metuens] After this
description of a tenipest, the Poct
proposes two methods of avoiding
such missortunes: one by a diligent
observation of the hearens 3 the
other by a religious worship of the
gods, especially of Ceres.

Cselz' mensem] By the months of
heaven, I take the Poet to mean the
twelve signs of the Zodiack, through
each of which the sun is about a
month in passing.

336.Frz'gz'cla.] Thus Pliny, (ί Sa-
“ turni autem sidus gelidae ac rigen-
(ί tis esse naturae.’' saturn may well
deserve the epithet of cold, its orb
being at a greater distance from the
sun than that of any· of the other
planets.

Receptet] Servius commends the
skill of Virgil in making choice ot'
this verb, which he thinks is de-

signed to express Saturn's returning
twice
