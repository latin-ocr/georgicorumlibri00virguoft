P. VIRGILII MARONIS

Torpent mole nova, et summis vix cornibus

370 ’

Hos non immissis canibus, non cassibus ullis
Puniceaeve agitant pavidos formidine pennae:
Sed frustra oppositum trudentes pectore montem
Comminus obtruncant ferro, graviterque ru·

Caedunt, 01 magno laeti clamore reportant. 375
Ipsi in defossis specubus secura sub alta
Otia agunt terra, congestaque robora, totasque

Advolvere focis ulmos, ignique dedere,
Hic noctem ludo ducunt, et pocula laeti

NOTES.

371. Non cassibus] In one 011110
Α1’1111(1011ε111 manuscripts it is nec cas..
sibus.

372. sziceoeve agitant paz-idos
formide'ne penum] lu one of Dr.
Mead’s manuscripts it is puniceaqzce.
In the King’s· manuscript it is pecudes
instead of pavido&

It was the custom 10 hang up co-
loured feathers on lines, to scare the
deer into the toils.

373. Sed frustra] Pierius snysit
is et frustra in the Roman manu-
script.

376. In defossisspecubus] Pom-
penius Mela, speaking of 1110 Sar-
matae, says they dig holes in the
earth for their habitations, 10 avoid
the severity of winier: ‘⁶ Sarmarae
‘⁶ auri et argenti, maximarum pes-
‘⁵ tium, ignari, vice rerum com-
‘⁶ mercia exercent: atque ob saeva
‘⁶ hyemis admodum assiduae, dev
‘⁴ mersis in humum sedibus, specus
“ aut suffossa habitant, totum brae-
‘⁴ cati corpus3 01 1ι151 qua vident,
‘⁴ etiam ora vestiti? And Tacitus
also says 1110 Germans used'to make
caves to defend them srom 1110 se-
verity of winter, and conceal their
corn: (ἒ Solent et subterraneos spa-

(ί 0115 aperire, eosque insuper multo
‘⁶² fimo onerant, suffugium «hyemi,
‘⁶ et receptaculum frugibus.⁷'

377. Totasque] Pierius says que
is left out in many ancient manu-
scripts. I find 1110 same reading, in
the King’S, the Bodleian, and in one
of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts, and in.
some of the old printed editions.

379. Pocula loeti fermento atque
acidis imitantur vitea sorbis] Ruaeus
interprets this passage to mean beer
and syder. 1‹‘e1·›nent2mz‚he says, sig-
nifies 1110 10111101111111011 of barley,
wheat, or oais: when by a certain
medicated heat the grain swells and
grows aeid, which are 1110 two effects
of fermentation3 which is therefore ’
named from jer-ceo, as 11 were servi!
mentum .- aud thus beer is made. The Χ
othm- liquor is expressed from aeid
berries aud fruits squeezed, such as
apples, pems, cornels, services: and ζ
is called waler, &c. Dr. Trapp in..
terprets 'fermentum yest or barm,
which, he thinks, 15 put sor 1110 liquot?
which it makes. But if fermentum
means-what we call yest or barm, I ·
should rather think 1110 Poet speaks
only of 0110 sort of liquor, made of
the juice of services, fermented with .

yest:
