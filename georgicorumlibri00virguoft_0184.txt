NOTES,

Grimoaldus reads castanea* fagos,
and thinks the Poet means a wild
sort of chesnats, for he paraphrases it
“in castanea sylvestri fagum.’' La
Corda contends that itshould be read
castaneas sagus, making fagus the
nominative case plural, like. lauru-5,
platanus, myrtus, which arc found in
some old copies. Dryden seems to
have read Castcnzeasjagas.·

‘¹ Thus mastful beech the bristly
“ chesnut bears.''

Dr. Trapp also highly approvesofthis
reading: “ l entirely agree, says he,
“ with those who read castaneas ja-
“gns, or caslaneoejagus, in Abra-
4‘mus's sense [See Ruaeus]; not.
“ castamaejagos. No body in his
“»wits would graft a beech upon a
“schesnut-l' His translation is ac—
cording to this latter sense. :.

‘⁶ --Chcsnuts bloom’d on beech.”

for my part Ι see no reason to reject
the common reading, castaueae fagos.
Thus Pierius found it in the Medi-
cean manuscript: and thus 1 find itin
all the seven manuscripts, which Ι
have collated. The Commentators
hare been induced to alter the text,
on a supposition‚ that chesnuts were
esteemed‚ in Virgil's time, as much
superior to beech-mast, as they are
now: the contrary to which I believe
may easily be proved. Pliny men-
tions chesnuts‚ as a very sorry sort
of fruit, and seems to wonder that
nature should take such care of them,

as to defend them with a prickly
husk : ‘⁴ Armatum iis echinato calyce
‘⁶ vallum, quod inchoatum glandi-
“ bus. Mirumque vilissima esse quae
‘⁶ tanta occultaverit cura naturae.”
We learn from the same author that
this fruit was made better byculture,
about the time os Tiberius: ‘⁴ Divus
‘⁴ Tiberius postea balanum nomen
¹· imposuit, excellentioribus satu
“factis'’ The mast of the beech
was reckoned a very sweet nut, and
men are said to have been sustained
by itin a. siege. “ Dulcissima om-
“nium fagi, says Pliny, ut qua ob-
“ sessos ctiam homines durassein op-
“ pido Chio, tradat Cornelius Alex-
“ ander.’' This tree was held in
great veneratior] by the Romans,
vessels made of it were used in their
sacrifices, and the mast was used by
them in medicine. Hence I see no
reason to doubt, that virgil meant
the ingral'ting a beech on a chesnut:
tho’ with us, who prefer the chesnut,
this practice would be absurd-

What the Romans called Omnes seems
to bc the -S'orbas cmcuparia or Qac'cloen-
ΐνιέ, which grows in mountainous
placvs3 not only in Italy,but in many
parts, especially the northern coun-
ties, of Eaglaml, where it is com-
monly called the Mountain Ash.
Columella says the (ἤπυε is a wild
sort of Ash, and that it's leaves are
broader, than those of the other
species : “ Sed si aspera et siticulosa.
“ loca arboribus obserenda erunt,
“ neque Opulus, neque Ulmus tam
“ idoneae sunt quam Orni. Eae syl-

“ vestres
