letter from Sir Daniel Molyneux‚
Bart. dated from Romo, July 27,
1737, with a drawing and description
of the plough, which is now used
about Mantua and Venice. 'l'here is
a plough used in many parts of Eng—
land, which differs very little sroni
this; but yet, Ι believe, it will be no
small satisfaction to my readers, to
find an exact account os the very
plough, now employed in cultivating
the lands in Virgil's own country.

The two timbers marked A are.
each made of one piece of wood,
and are fastened together with three
wooden pins at B.

C, C, are two transverse pieces of
wood, which serve to hold the han-
dles together at the back.

D is a piece of wood fastened to
the left handle, or Sinistrella, at E,
and to the bean} Γ.

F is the beam, or Portica, which
is fastened to the left handle, at G.

H is the plough-share, into which
the Dentale, or share-bearn, seems to
be inserted.

Ι is the coulter, being a piece of
iron, square in the body, which is
fixed in the beam, and bending in the
lower part, and having an edge, to
cut the weeds.

L is aniron chain, fastened at one
end to the plough-pilloxv, οι· BIesolo
N; and, at the other, to the beam
by an iron hammer M; the handle
of which serves for a pin, and the
more forward you place the hammer,
the. deeper the share goes into the
ground.

Ο 0, are two piceos of wood fast=

ened to the pillow‚ which serve to
keep the beam in the middle.

P is the pole, or TimonzeHa, to
which the oxen are yoked, and is of
no certain length.

Q, R, with prickt lines is astrong
plank, which is fastened to D, and to
the left handle. This being placed
sloping serves to turn up the earth,
and make the furrow wider. This
part therefore is the earth-board, or
auris, of virgil, of which hc says
there should he two: but in this
plough there ¹seems to be but one.

I do not question, but that the
Mantuani plough was in Virgil's
time, more simple than that here de-
scribed : but let us compare a little
the Poet‘s description with the figure
now before us. Let the left handle
A A, be supposed to bestie Buris,
the right handle A A, to be the Slivu,
and A E, A B, to be the two Denta'-
lia. Here then we see the crooked
Buris, to form which an elm was
bent as it grew. Near the bottom .
ofthis, huic a stirpe, we see the pole
is inserted, which probably was con-
tinued to the length of ,eight feet,
and had the oxen yoked to it, with-
out the intervention of the Timon-
zella. Thus the plough wanted the
advantage of having the share go
lighter or deeper, which may be a
modern improvement. The two
handles may very well be supposed to
be meant by the double back, to
which the two share-beams are join-
ed. Upon this supposition we must
make some alteration in interpreting

the two following verses :
