NOTES.

350. Vilrez'sque sedilibus] In the
King's manuscript it is vitreis quoque
sedibus.

352. Flavum] Pierius reads pla-
ciclum ι but he is better pleased with
flavum, which hc found in most of
the ancient manuscripts.

355. Penei genitoris] We have
seen already, that Peneus,⁷ according
to Pindar, was the grand-father of
Cyrene¹

357. Huic] In one of the Arun-
delian, one of Dr. Mead’s manu-
scripts, and in some old printed edi..
tions, it is hinc.

359. Discedere] It is descendere
in one of Dr. Mcad⁷s manuscripts,

361. Cartala in montis faciem]
Thus Homer:

Πορφύρξον δ’ εἶρα. κῦμα περισἾοίθη οὔ·
ρει mov
Κυρτωθέν, κρύψεν τε Sim.

Thus also Ovid:

(ί Cum mare surrexit 3 cumulusque·
‘⁶ immanis aquarum·

‘⁶ In montis speciem curvari, et cres.
‘⁶ cere visus.”

363. Jamque domum, δια] This
paragraph contains the entrance of
Aristaeus within the earth, and his
astonishment at the sight of the sour-
ces of the several rivers.

Servius observes, that what is here
said is not by a poetical‘liberty, but
is taken from the sacred mysteries of
the Egyptians. For on certain days
sacred to the. Nile, some bOyS‚ born
os holy parents, were delivered to the
nymphs by the priests. who, when
they were grown up and returned
back, related that there were groves
under the earth, and an immense water
containing all things, and srom which
every thing is procreated. Whence,
according to Thala, Oceanumque paq

trem rerum.
Homer
