sulphur,

N OT Es,

The same author adds Hellebore to
his linimus, when it is to be applied
to a sheep in which the disease is al-
ready begun: ‘⁴ Facit autem com-
‘⁶ mode primum ea compositio, quam
‘⁶ paulo ante demonstravimus, si ad
‘⁶ faecem et amurcam, succumque
‘⁶ decocti lupini misceas portione ω-
“ qua detritum album Elleborum.'’
It must be allowed that the oint-
ment which Virgil here describes is
. an excellent composition.

Amarea] The lees of oil are much
{in use in Italy, and other countries
where oil is made. We find it re-
‚commended b'y Cato sor many pur-
poses. We find the virtues of it. col-
lected by Dioscorides‚ It is, says he,
the dregs of oil, Being boiled in a
copper'vessel to the consistence of
honey, it is astringent, and has the
other effects of Lycium. It is ap-
plied to the tooth-ach and to wounds
with vinegar and wine: it is added
to medicines for the eyes⁷ and to
those which obstruet the potes, It
is the better sor being old. It is ap-
plied with success to ulcers os the
unus and pudenda. If it is boiled

’ again with verjuice 10 the consistence

of lioney it draws out rotten teeth.
It heals the scab in cattle, being made
into a l‘1niment with the decoction
of lupinos and chamaeleon. It is of
great service to anoint the gout and
pains of the joints with dregs of oil.
A skin with the hair on smeared
⁸ with it, and applied to the dropsy
‘diminishes the swelling: Ἀμόργῃ,

'call litharge.
