one single storin7 but that the sea, is
tossed by many whirlwinds, each of
which precedes a storm. That a
violent storm is usually preceded by a
whirlwind is most certain z therefore
to enter into a (lebatesuhether tlxe
whirlwind is to be accounted a fore-
runner of a storm, or a part of the
storm itself, would be a mere logo-
machy.

471 . Quam mallee pecudum pestes]
The Poet cannot mean that pesti-
lences or murrains are as common
among the cattle‚„as storms on the
sea. Pestis is a more general word,
and includes all the several great mis-
fortune-s that attend them. Thus
a little before, he calls a serpent
Pestis acerba boum.

472. AEslz‘va.] AEstiva are the
‘⁶ shady places, in which the cattle

Norica] Noricum was a region of
Gerrnaiiy, bordering on the Alps,
Great part of it is what we now call
Bouaria.

Iapides arva Timavi] Some read
Iapygis ; but Iapygia was a part of the
kingdom of Naples, far distant from
the Alps, of which Virgil is here
speaking. lapidis is certainly the true
meaning: sor Iapidia was in the Ve-
netian territory, where the river Ti.

now called Friuli.

Schrevelius and Masvicius read
arma instead of arva.

Timavus is a river of Carniola: it
is now called Timavo.
