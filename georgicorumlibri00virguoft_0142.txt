The sun also, both when he ri-
εες, and when he dips nimsdf
in the waveS, will give signs:
the surest signs attend the sun ;
both those which he brings in
the morning, and il use when
the stars arise. When at his
first rising he appears spotted‚
and hid in a cloud, and witn-
draws half his crb5

P. vraean MARoNJs'

Sol quoque et exoriens, et cum se condit in undas,
Signa dabit3 solem certissima signa sequuntur-3

Et quae mane refert, et quae surgentibus astris. 440

Conditus in nubem, medioque refugerit orbe ;

NOTES.

virgil leaves the vowels open, aster
the manner of the Greek Poets.
Glaucus was a fisherman, who,
observing that his ssah, by touching a
certain herb, recovered their strength,
and leaped again into the water, had
the curiosity to taste of it himself:
upon which he immediately lea‘ped
into the water and became a sea-god.
Panopea was one of the Nereius.
She is mentioned in the fifth AEncid:

‘⁶ Dixit3 eumque imis sub fluctibus
‘⁶ audiit omnis

‘⁴ Nereidum Phorcique chorus, Pa..
‘⁶ nopeaqne virg03

‘⁴ Et pater ipse ,nanu magna Portu-
ί( nus euntem

‘⁶ Impulit.’'

Ino was the daughter of Cadmus,
and wife of Athamas, king of Thebes,
Flying ¹from the fury of her husband,
who had already torn one of their
children in pierres, she threw herself
into the sea, with her son Melicerta.
They were both changed into sca.
deities : Ino was called by the Greeks
Leucothea, and by the Romans Ma-
tuta: Melicerta was called by the
Greeks Palaemon, and by the Ro-
mans Portunus.

438. Sol qnoque, δέ] In this pas-
sage are contained the predictions
drawn from the rising and setting of
the sun. ·

The three first lines are taken from
as many of Aratus z

Ἠελίοιο δέ τοι μελέτω Enim& ἰόν*
τος·

Ἠελίῳ καὶ μᾶλλαν ἐοικότα σνῖμιοιτω
κεῖται
Ἃμφότερον, &dnm-a, καὶ ἐκ περάτης

α’νιόντι·

Condit] It is condet in one. of the
Arundelian, and both Dr. Mead’s ma-
nuscripts: several printed editions
have the same reading. I follow
Heinsius.

439. Sequuntur] Itis sequentur
in the Cambridge, one of the Arun-
delian, one of Dr. Mead⁷s manu-
scripts, and in several printed editions.
Pierius says it is sequuntur in the
Roman, the Medicean, and the Lom-
bard manuscript, and thinks this the
best reading. Servius, La Cerda, and
some others read sequentur. Heinsius,
Ruaeus, and others read sequuntur.

441. Macares variaverit ortum]
Thus Aratus:

Μή οῖ ποικῖλλοιτο νέον βάλλοντος α’ροιξ-

ραις ,
Κύκλος, ὅτ’ ἒυδῖου κεχρημένος ἤματος
εἰἠς,
Μηδέ τι σῆμα φέροι, φαίνοιτο δὲ λιτὸς
οἱποὶντη.

442. Conditus in nubem] Thus

Aratus ε
Μηῖ
