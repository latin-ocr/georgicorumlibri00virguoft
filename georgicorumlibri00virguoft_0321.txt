In the fifth AEneid it is used sor the

whilzeness of bones blanched on a

‘⁵‘ Difficiles quondam, multorumque
“ ossibus albos.”

In the seventh AEneid, for the white.

In vultus sese transformat

'“ Et frontem obscoenam rugiS arat:

“ Cum vitta crines.”

And again in the ninth:

“ Omnia longaevo similis, vocemque,
“ coloremque ,
“ Et crines albos.’'

In the second Eclogue we have both

candidus and albus in the same signi-
fication t

And in the twelfth AEneid the blushes
of the beautiful Lavinia are compared

lilies are called alba, which being
compared to the sair complexion of
this lady, I hope will not be sups
posed to be of a dirty white: ν

“ Accepit vocem lacrymis Lavinia

But what I think will put it past al}
dispute, that Virgil made no dif.
serence of colour between albus and
candidus, is that, in the eighth AEneid,
the very same white sow, which in
ver. 45. he called alba, is called ccm‘v
