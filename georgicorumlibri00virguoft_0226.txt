to express, that when a wood has
been grubbed up, the rude unculti-

in full beauty after it has been
plowed.

'lhcophi 1155111 ‚ in th( fourth chapter
of the ninth hook oi his History of

1111111111100115 0, and cinnamon, and

chapter he seems to describe it as a

In the seventh chapt( r, I'heophrastus
mentions it ‹imongst the spices, 11 111011

Theophrastus speaks in these places,
is an aromatic bark‚ not much unlike
cinnamon, and may therefore not
improb 1ny be that which we call
Cassia lianea. It is of this bark,
11111011 virgil speaks in ver. 466. of
this Gemgick· .

‘⁶ Nec Casia liquidi corrumpitur usus

Columelia speaks of it amongst other
exotics which had lately been in-
troduced into 1110 Roman gardens3

if at all known, in Italy, in Virgil’s
time, as 110 5001115 to make it in all
the passages, vibere 110 mentions it,
except that just now quoted. In the
second Eclogue Alexis the Shepherd
makes a nost gay of Casia, with lilios,
violets, poppieS‚ daffodils, dill, hya-
cynthS, and marigold8‚ which are all
common herbs or flowers; and it is

there explessly mentioned as a sweet
