NOTES.

92. Ne tenues plu-ricc, rapidircpo-
tentia solis amima] This passage lias
very much perplexcd some of 1110
Commentators. They think 11 strange
that rain should 110 said to scorch tlie
ground. La Corda interprets it ‘⁸ ne
“ plurim, quae tenuitate sua pene-
“ 11301, herbas pet·‹lant.'’ Dryilcu
translates it :

“ Lost soaking show’rs should picrce
“ her secret seat.''

And Dr. Trapp z

-- —— — Lest d risling show'rs
should soal< too deep.

 

This seems 1ο be taking too great a
liberty with virgil 2 to suppose aii 01-
110515, 0011111011 10 fill it up with what
we please. Ι would rather suppose
tlizit by termes, 110 (10051101 mean qnae
tenuitate sua penetrant ; but as Scr-
vius tells 115,50010 interpret it, inutiles,
jejuare, onacrcr, 10 0000511100 10 piu-
gues, as tennis ula· argilla. lf we 1111-
derstand it in 11115 ¹sense, why might
1101 the Poet say that the fire, by con-
naming 1110 gaping veins of 1110 earth,
111111101-51110 small showers from 5001011-
ing 1110, earth 2 that 15, 1111111015 [lie
earth from being scorclied or drie‹l‚
by 1110 smallness of 1110 51100015,
wliicli art· not sufficient to 01015100 it ;
but soak through it's gaping chinks.
Tliisinterpretation will be still clearer
if with Schrevclius we read rapidique,

instead ofrapidiz'e: sor then the sens:¹
will be that the small showers joined
with a very ρει-0010811001 will dry up
the spongy, thirsty soil. They may
poetically be said to parch the earth,
because they are 1101 sufficient to hin-
(101 11 from being patched.

95. Penetrabilc frigus] Thus Lu-
cretius :

‘⁵ Pei-manat calor argentum, penetra-
“ leque frigusf’

Adurat] Burning applied 10 00111

15 001 merely a poetical expression:
but we find it made use ofalso by the
Philosophors. Aristutle says that cold
is accidentally aii active body, and is
sometimes said to burn and warin, not
111 the Same marim-i· as beat, but bc-
001150 11 condensos or consti-ains the
