NOTES.

⁶⁶ κατὰ amoris στέρησιν detestatus
“ est.’⁴ In the second place he says
that laudare signified anciently to
name3 therefore illaudatus or illaa-
dabilis signifies one who ought not
to be named, as it was formerly de-
creed by. the Asiatic states, that none
should ever name the man who had
set fire to the temple of Diana at E-
phesuS. ‘⁶ Altero modo illaudatus
‘⁶ ita defenditur. Laudare significat
“ prisca lingua nominare appellare-
‘⁶ que. Sic in actionibus civilibus
‘⁶ auctor laudari dicitur, quod est
(ί nominari. Illaadatas enim est quasi
‘⁴ illaudabilis, qui neque mentione aut
“ memoria ulla dignus, neque un-
‘⁴ quam nominandus est. Sicuti
‘⁴ quondam a communi consilio Asiae
“ decretum est, uti nomen erS, qui
“templum Dianae Ephesia} incen-
“ derat, ne quis ullo in tempore no.
‘4 minaret.” Some are of opinion
that Virgil here reflects on Isocrates,
who composed an Oration in praise
of Busiris. But the Oration os Iso-
crates does not seem so much to be
designed in praise of Busiris, as to
expose one PolycrateS, who had un-
dertaken to praise him, and yet had
not said any one thing of him, which
deser-ved commendation. Quintil.
lian thinks Polycrates composed this
Oration, rather to shew his wit, than
for any other purpose: ‘⁴ Equidem
‘⁶ illos qui contra disputarunt, non
‘⁶ tam id sensisse quod dicerent, quam
‘⁶ exercere ingenia materiae difficul-
“ tate credo voluisse ; sicut Polycra-
“ *tem cum Busirim laudaret, et

‘⁶ Clytemnestram t quanquam is, ’
‘⁶ quod his dissimile non esset, com..
‘⁴ posuisse orationem, quae est habita
‘⁶ contra Socratem, dicitur.’' There.
fore if Virgil designed to reflect on
any Orator, it must rather have been
on Polycrates than on Isocrates. Af.
ter all, I believe Virgil intended to
express a great abhorrence of the
cruelties ascribed to Busiris, by this
negative ofpraise, as he has called the
Stygian lake inamabilis in two diffe-
rent places. The first is in the fourth
Georgick:

(ί Tardaque palus inamabilis
‘⁶ unda.’'

 

The other is in the sixth AEneid :

‘6

 

Tristique palus inamabilis
‘⁴ unda.'’ ⁷

And in the twelfth AEneid he uses in
like manner illaetabile, to express
the horrid murmur of a distracted

city :

‘⁶ Attulit hunc illi coecis terroribus

‘⁶ aura

“commixtum clamorem, arrectas-
‘⁴ que impulit aures

‘⁶ Confusae sonus urbis, et illaetabile χ
“ murmur.”

Nor are examples of this way of
speaking wanting among other an-
thors. Cicero seems to be speaking
in praise of Quintus Pompeius, when

he calls him a not contemptible
Orator:
