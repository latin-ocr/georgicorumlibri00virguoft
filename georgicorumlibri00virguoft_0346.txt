152. Hoc quondam monstro, &C.]
Io the daughter of Inachus uns be-
loved „by Jupiter, who, to conceal
her from Juno, turned her into a
cow. But Juno discovering the de-
ceit sent an oeslrus to torment Io,
with which being stung she flod into
Egypt, where being restored to her
former shape, she was married to
king Osiris, and after her death was
worshipped as a goddess, under the
name 011515.

155. Pet-ora] ln both Dr. Mead's
manuscripts it is pecorique: but
the que is injudiciously added, to
avoid a Synaloepha. See the note 011
book Ι. ver. 4.

156. Astus] In the Cambridge
manuscript, and in some of the old
printed editions it is austris.

157. Post partum, δια] The Poet
having first described the care that
is to be taken of the sire before co-
pulation, then of the dam, during
her pregnancy, now tells us, that all
our care is to be bestowed ou the
young ones, as soon as they are
brought into the world, and begins
with the Canes.

Pierius reads

Post partum ῐη vitulos cura traducitur
om ms .·

buthe says it is

Postpartum cura in vitulos traducitur
omnes

in the Roman, the Medicean, the
LomDard, a'nd some other manu-
scripts. He says also, that in the
oblong manuscript, which Pompo.
nius Laetus called his delicia», itis
deducitur, instead of traducz'tur; but
he thinks the common reading is
best.

ver. 75.
