115. Pictos Gelonos] The Geloni
werea people of Scythia, who painted
their faces, like several other barba·
rous nations, to make themseives ap-
pear more terrible in battle. Some
have erroneously, contrary to all
Geographers, placed the Geloni in
Thrace: and Ruaeus thinks that
Virgil himself seems to make them
Thraciuns, in the third Georgick,
where he says;

Thrace, and the Getae border upon
Scythia and Thrace. 1 believe the
Poet uses Rhodope sor Thrace3 and
the desarts of the Gctae are contes-

makes the Geloni to be Getae as
Thracians, nay that he makes them
both Getae and Thracians, which is
absurd. It seems more probable that
when he speaks of their flying into
Thraco, and the desarts of the Ge-
tae, he should mean flying out of
their own country3 whence it will
follow that they were neither Getae
nor Thraciam, but Scythians.
