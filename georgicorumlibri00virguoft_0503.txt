Quaeritur3 huic geminae nares, et spiritus oris 300

Tunsa per integram solvuntur viscera pellem.

NOTES.

295. Exiguus primum, ἃς] It
was the general opinion of anriquity,
that Beesa were produced from the
putrid bodies of cattle. Varro says
they are called Βουγέναι by the Greeks,
because they arise from putrified bul-
looks: ⁶⁶ Denique ex hoc putrefacto
⁶⁶ nasci dulcissimas apes mellis ma-
‘⁶ tres, a quo eas Graeci βςυγέ-ιας
⁶⁶ appellant.’' And in another place
he mentions their rising from these
putrid animals, and quotes the au-
thority of Archelaus, who says ssees
proceed from bullocks, and wasps
from horses: ⁶⁶ Apes nascuntur par-
‘-‘ tim ex apibus, partim cx bubulo
‘⁶ corpore putrefacto. Itaque Arche..
‘⁶ laus in epigrammate ait eas esse

“— -,— Βοός φθινομένης πεποιημένοι
‘5 τέκνα.

⁶⁶ Idem ι

‘⁶ Ἵππων μὶν σφῆκες γενεαὶ, μόσχων δὲ
“ μέλισσαι.”

Above all, we have the author-Ity of
the Holy Scriptum, that Bees will
procced from the putrid carcase of an

animal. For, as we read in the
fourteenth chapter of the book of
Jndges, ⁶⁶ Samson went down, and
⁶⁶ his father, and his mother, to
⁶⁶ Timnath, and came to the vine-
⁶⁶ yards of Timnath: and behold a
⁶⁶ young lion roared against him.
⁶⁶ And the spirit of the Lord came
⁶⁶ mightily upon him, and he rent
“him as he would have rent a kid
⁶⁶ . . . . and after a time .

‘⁶ he turned aside to see the carcase‘
⁶⁶ of the lion, and behold there was
⁶⁶ a swarm of Bees, and honeyin
⁶⁶ the carcase of the lion.” Itis
not however to be imzzgined, that in-
sects are generated from a putrefac-
tion. The truth is, such carcases are
a proper receptacle for their young ;
and therefore the female parent
chooses there to lay her eggS‚ that
the warmth of the fermenting juices
may help to hatch them.

says it is obsuitur in the old Colotian
manuscript.
