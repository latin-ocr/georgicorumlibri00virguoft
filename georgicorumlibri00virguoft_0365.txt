Do you not see how the horse
trembles all over, if he does
but snuff the weil known
gales’ And now neither
brhltes, nor the severe stourges
of the rider÷, not rocks and
caverns, anrl rivers interposed,
that whirl mountaius along
with their torrents, can re-
sti-ain them. Even the Sabei-
lian boar rushes, and whcts

Lybia is the Greek name sor
Africa, according to Pliny: ‘⁶ Afri-
‘⁶ cam Graeci Lybiam appellavere.'’
This country abounds with the
fier-cest wild beasts.

bridge, the Arundelian, and one of
Dr. Mead’s manuscripts.

manuscript.

254. Correptosque unda torquentia
montes] The common reading is
correptos without que.- but Pierius

the Roman, the Lombard, and other
ancient manus cripts. The same read.'

255. Ipse rm't', δια] Aristotle
speaking of the wild boars says, that
at this time they rage horribly, and
fight one with another, making their'
skins very hard by rubbing against
trees, and by often rolling themselves

¹iu the mud, and letting it dry,

make their backs almost impenetra-
ble; and fight so furiously that:
both of them are often killed· Ka?

Corda contends that the Poet is
here speaking of the wild boar,
contrary to the opinion of Servius and
the other Commentators. But I be.
lieve 'they are in the right; for
Virgil had spoken before of the
wild boar3 ‘⁶ tum soevus aper:'’
and here he says even the Sabellian
boar rages; ‘⁶ ipse Sabellicus sus ε’·
that is, not only the wild boar, but
even the tame one rages at this time;
