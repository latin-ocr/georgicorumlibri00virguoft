⁷ NOTES.

Butit is not probable, that this 1160
should 11316 it's rise in Thrace, as it
is known to be the growth of warmer
elimatos. Nor is such a guilt con-
sistent with the extraordinary passion
of Orpheus for his Eurydice. Our
Poet himself has been accused of the
same unnatnral inclinations, but, I
think, without any good reason. 'she
principal argument is taken from the
second Eelogue, where the Poet de-
scribes the passion of Corydon for
Alexis. Here he is supposed to mean
himself under the name of Corydon,
which however cannot be proved.
Nor is it at all to be wondercd at,
that he should describe his shepherds
as subject to that vice, which is still
too common 111 1116 country where
116 lived. A Poet must represent
mankind as they are, given up 10
various follies, 11065, 31111 1135510115.
Therefore he makes his shepherds
subject to such passions, as he 6156.
where sufficiently shews that 116 does
not approve. And at the close of
that very Eclogue, Corydon begins
to discover 1115 fully, and repent
of it:

‘⁴ Ah Corydon, Corydon, quante
‘³‘ dementia cepit!

Dryden endeavours to vindicate his
author from this censure, but at the
same time takes paius to shew that
he was averse from the sair sex, which,
if true, would strengthen the 3001153.

the character os one good woman in

all his poems. But notwithstanding
these concessions of his celebrated
translator, I shall venture to affirm,
that virgil had other thoughts of
women. He has indeed represented
Dido under no very advantageous
character. But this was not 111111
any design of casting a slur upon the
sex, but 011 1116 Carthaginians, the
