Au of thern labour together,
and all rest at the same time,

N OTES.·

Nih ὖάκινθε aalma ταὶ σὰ γςοίμμαΊα, καὶ
πλέον ΑΙ, Α Ι,

Anat-Cau σοῖς πετάλοισι· καλὸς τέθιακε
μελικτοίς.

The Poets feign that the boy Hya-
cinthus, who was unfortunately kill-
ed by Apollo, was changed by that
deity into a Hyacinth, which there.
fore was marked with these notes of

lamentation to express Apollo’s grief.
Thus Ovid:

‘⁵ Semper eris mecum, memorique
‘⁴ haerebis in ore.

(ί Tc lyra pulsa manu, te carmina
‘⁶ nostra sonabunt:

‘⁵ Flosque novus scripto gemitus imi-
‘⁶ tabere nostros.”

‘⁶ — Thou shall with me abz'de
“ Auel ever in my memory reside.

4‘ Οιιι· harp and verse thy praises .

‘⁴ shall resound:
’ζ Audin thyflozore my sorrow shall
“ befound.'’
SANDYS.

It is also seigned, that the same
flower arose from the blood of Ajax,
when he slew himself3 those letters
being half the name of that hero'.
Thus ovid:

ὅ( tellus

“ Purpureum viridi genuitde cespite
‘⁶ florem,

“ Qui prius OEbalio suerat de vnlnere
‘⁶ natus.

‘⁶ Litera communis mediis pueroque

‘⁴ Inscripta est foliis: haec nominis,
‘⁶ illa querela.”

SANDYS.

To this virgil seems to allude in thej
third Eclogue :

‘⁶ Dic quibus in terris inscripti no.
‘⁶ mina regum

‘⁵ Nascantur flores; et Phyllida solus
‘⁶ habeto.''

A flou-et· that bears inscrib'cl the

DRYDEN.

I must not forget to observe, that the
vaccinium mentioned by our Poet in
the second and tenth Edogues, is not
different from what in other places
he calls hyacinthus .- the latter being
the Greek name, aud the former a.

Latin name derived from it. Iigr
