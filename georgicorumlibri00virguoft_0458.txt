Narcissus is a sort os purple Lily,

cup: it differs from Lines in that
its leaves come from the root: the
best sort grows in the mountains of
Lycia. There is another sort with
a herbaceous cup. All of them

other with a herbaceous flower:

From what these ancient authors
have said, we may gather a pretty
good description of their Narcissus.
The roots arelarge, round, and fieshy,
according to Theophrastus3 white,
round, and bulbouS, according to
Dioscorides. They all agree, that
the leaves proeeed from the root, aud
that the stalk is naked. According
to Theophrastus, the leaves are like
those ofAsphode13 according to Dios.
corides, like those of LeekS, but
smaller and narrower, in which thoy
agree very well. The flower, ac.
cording to Theophrastus, is greenish,
according to Dioscorides white, and
either yellow or purple withinj, ac,
cording to Pliny, it is white, with
cithera purple or greenish cup. What
Dioscorides calls the inside, is what
Pliny calls the cup; for the ssowers
of the Daffodil form a cup in the
middle, which is sometimes different,

sometimes os the same colour with
