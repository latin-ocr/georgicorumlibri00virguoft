NOTES.

‘¹' vestes, juvenci. Ne quos quidem

“ iu trigariis praeferri ullos vernacu-
“ lis animadverto. Metallis auri,
“ argenti, aeris, ferri, quamdiu libuit
‘⁶ exercere, nullis cessit. Et iis nunc
“ in se gravida pro omni dote varios
“ succoe, et frugum pomorumque
“ sapores fundit.''

176. Ascraeum carmem] By As-
croecm V erse he means, that he fol-
lows Hesiod, who was of Ascra in
Boeotia, and wrote of husbandry iu
Greek verse.

177. Nunc locus, &c.] Here the
Poet speaks of the different soils,
which are proper for olives, vines,
pastui-e, and corn.

178. Et.] In one of the Arun-
delian manuscripts, and several of
the old printed editions it is aut.

Fer-endis] In one of the Arun-
delian manuscripts it is creandis.

179. Difficiles primum terrm] The
same soil does not agree with olives
in all countries. Thus Pliny tells us,
that a fat soil suits them in some
places, and a gravelly soil in others:
‘⁴ Glareosum oleis solum aptissimum
⁶⁴ in Venafrano, pinguissimum in Boe-
“ tica.'’ The soil where Virgil lived
is ‹lamp, being subject to the inun-
dations of the Po, and therefore he
recommends the hilly and stony lands
for the culture of olives, We find

in Pliny, that the country about La-
rissa formerly abounded with olives,
but that the land being chilled by
the overflowing of a lake they were
all lost: “ In Thessalia circa Laris-
“ sam emisso lacu frigidior facta ea.
“ regio est, oleaque desierunt quae
“ prius fuerant.''

180. Tenuis ubi atgilla] May
translates this, where clay is scarce:
which is an error-3 for tenuis signifies
lean or hungry. Argilla is not our
common clay, but Potter’s clay,
which Columella observes is as hun-
gry as saud: ‘⁴ Creta, qua utuntur
“ figuli, quamque nonnulli argillam
“ vocant, inimicissima est [viti]; nec
‘⁵ minus jejuna sabulo.''

181. Palladia] Pallas or Minerva
was said to be the discoverer of the
olive-tree. See the note on ver. 18.
of the first Georgick.

Vivacis] We have seen, in the
note on ver. 3. of this Georgick‚ that
the olive is 3 slow grower, and there-
fore he here calls it long-lived.

182. oleaster] This is a wild sort
of olive, which seems to be different
from the cultivated sort, only by
it's wssdness, as crabs from apples.

'l'hat plant which is cultivated in our

gardens under the name of Oleaster‚
is notan olive: Tournefort refers it
to his genus of ElaeagnUS. It grows
