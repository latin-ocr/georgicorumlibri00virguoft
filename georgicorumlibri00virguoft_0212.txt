metals, but that the digging them up
was forbid by a decree of the senate:
‘⁶ metallorum omnium fertilitate
“nullis cedit terris. Sed interdic-
“ tum id vetere consulto patrum,
‘⁴ Italiae parci jubentium.'' In lib.
xxxiii. cap. 4, he mentions the Po
ainongst the rivers which afford gold.
In the same chapter he confirms what
hc had said before os the decree of
the senate: “ Italice parcitum ost
“· vetere interdicto patrum, ut dixi-
‘· mue, alioquin nulla foecundior
“metallorum quoque erat tellus.'’
At the end os his work, where he
speaks of the excellence of Italy,
above all other counfflcs, he men-
tions gold, silves, copper, and iron:
“ Metellis auri, argenti, aeris, ferri,
“ quamdiu libuit exercere, nullis ces-
“ sit.” Virgil seems to allude to this
ancient discovery of means, by using
ostendit andfluxit in the preterperfect
tense.

AEris metalla] AEs is commonly
translated Brass: but Copper is the
native metal3 Brass being made of
Copper melted with Lapis Calamina-
νίς. In the Cambridge manuscript
it is mctalli, which is wrong: for the
ancient Roinans did not say ωε metal-
lum, but (Γπ-ῖς metalla. We find auri
metalla, argenti metalla, and aeris me-
talla in Pliny.

166. Plurima] See the note on
this word, in ver. 187. of the first
Georgick.

167. Htw] In one of Dr. Mead’s

manuscripts it is hoc, which must be
an error of the transcriber.

fllarsoa] The Marsi were a very
valiant people of Italy, said to be de·
scended from Marsus, the son of
Circe. They inhabited that part of
Italy, which lay about the Lacus Fu-
cinus, now called Lago Fucino, or La-
go cli Celano. lt is now part of the
kingdom of Naples.

Pubem Sabellam] The Sabelli were
anciently called Ausones. They in-
habited that part of Italy, which was
called Somnium.

168. Assuetumque malo Ligurem]
The Ligurians inhabited that part of
Italy, which is now the Republic
of Genoa. Some have thought that
assuetum malo signifies accustomed to
tleceit, which was imputed as a na-
tional crime to the Ligurians, and is

mentioned by Virgil himself, in the
cleventh AEneid ;

“ V ane Ligur, frustraque animis
“ elate superbis,

‘⁴ Nequicquam patrias tentasti lubri-
“ cus artes :

‘⁶ Nec fraus te incolumem fallaci
“ perferet Auno.'’
