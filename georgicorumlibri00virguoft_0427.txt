531. Tempore non alio, ἃς] Ser-
vius, and after him many others
imagine that the Poet here alludes to
the famous story of Cleobis and 131-
ton, the sons os a priestess ofJuno at
Argos, who, when the beasts were
not ready at the time of the sacrifice,
yoked themselves, and drew their
mother to the temple. Tho priestcss
hereupon intreated the goddess, to rea
ward the piety other sons with the
greatest good, that could befal men z
‘which she granted ’'o-s causing thern
to be found dead in their beds the
next morning. The reader will 111111
this story related by HerodotuS, by
Plutarch 111 his treatise ofConsolation,
addresscd to Apollonius, and by Ci-
cero, in his first book of'l‘usculan
Questions. But I do not stud any
mention of a scarclty of cattle by
means of any plague 3 but only that
the mules or bullocks were either not
ready soon enough, or were tired as

they drew the chariot. Resides, the
scene of this story is laid at Argoa,
whereas virgil is speaking of the
Alps.

534. Ergo (egre, &c.] The Poet
describes the great mortallty of cattle,-
by saylng the people were forced to
scratch the earth with their nalls, in
order to sou‘ or rather set their corn,
scarce being able to drag the har.
rows over the fields, and that they
