GEORG. LIB. ΙῘ.

Sollicitanda tamen tellus, pulvisque movendus,
Et jam maturis metuendus Jupiter uvis.
Contra, non ulla est oleis cultura: neque illae
Procurvam expectant falcem, rastrosque te-

naces ;

Cum semel hae-serunt arvis, aurasque tulerunt.
Ipsa satis tellus, cum dente recluditur unco,

yet the earth must be turned
up, aud the dust siin-ed, and
Jupiter is to be feared, even
when the izi-apes are quire
ripe· On the contrary, the
olives require uoculture, noi·
do they expect the crookca
hook, aud strong barton-53
when once they liare taken
root iu the fields, and stood

affords sufficient nioisture,
when it is opened with the
hooked drag,

Haring shewed the great labour
xi hich attends the care of a vineyard3
he now opposes the olire to it, which
requires hardly any culture. He sa) s
the same of other fruit trees, and
mentions the wild plants, which are
produced abundantly3 aud thence he
infers, that if nature affords us so
many useful plants, we ought not to
'be backward in planting, and bestow-
ing our ownlabour.

In the Bodleian manuscript it is
nonnulla, Servius mentions this read-
ing. But it seems to be making the
Poet guilty of arery poor expression
to say, Vines require α great deal of
culture ; but, οη tlte contrary, olives
require some.

Virgil does not say in this passage,
that olives require no culture at all 3
but that they hare no occasion for
any, after they hare once taken to
the ground, and grown strong.
They have no occasion for harrows,
and pruning hooks3 and need only
a little breaking of the ground, aud
some plowiug- Columella dues not
greatly differ from the Po( t. 110 says
no tree requires so much culture
as the vine, or so little as the olive.
