NOTES.

several other good editors. Servius
reads et clarae,· but he says that some
read edurae, as it were non αἶαν-ιη
like enodes for sine nodis. Pierius says
that in some ancient manuscripts it is

“inches long-'¹ This is the way
which Columella 1·ecom1nends; who
calls this sort of cutting malleolus,
because it bears no ill resemblance to
Ι do not know

that we have any proper English
word soz-malleolus, tho' it is a cutting
ofa different nature from that which
is usually taken from other trees. Co-
lumella mentions also the propaga-
tion of vines by layers, in his seventli
book de Arboribus.

64. Sol-islo Paphia: de robore IlIyr-
tus] In one of the Arundelian 1na-
nuscripts it is melius instead of so-
Iido.

The myrtles are called Paphian
from Paphosa city of the island Cy-
prus, where Venus was worshipped.
The myrtle was sacred to that god-
dess: see the note on ver. 28. of the
first book,

By solido cle robore he seems to
means planting by sets. Thus Mr.
B—— seems to understand him:

‘⁶ ——-- M yrtles by huge boughs.''

With us they are propagated by cut·

tingS, and removed into the green· ’

house in winter.

65. Plantz‘s edurae Ceryli nascun-
tur] By plantis the Poet means
suckers3 which is a method still in
common practice: though it is now
, found to be a better way to propa-
gate them by layerS.

1 read edura: with Heinsiu5‚ ancl

edmoe, but in the greater part et da-
rae. One of the Arundelian manu·
scripts has et darm, and the other
edurae. The King's, the Cambridge,
and the Bodleian manuscripts have ec
(ίαν-ιε. Both Dr. Mead’s manuscripts
have edurae. Grimoaldus, Paul Ste-
phens, La Cerda, Schrevelius, and
several other editors read et duroe,
Ruaeus, and many others read edaroe.
This last Commentator interprets
eduroe, valde durae: and the hazle
being a hard wood‚ this interpretation
seems to be better than that of Ser-
vius.

One of the Arundelian manu.
scripts reads nascentur, instead of nas-
cuntur.

66. Herculeaeque arbos umbrosa co,
ronae.] The trec of Hercules was
the poplar: Thus Theocritus, in his
second Idyllium:

“ Λεύκων, εἩρακλέος ἴερὲν ἔρνος :'’

 

and our Poet, inhis seventh eclogue2
“ Populus Alcidae gratissima.”

1t is certain that the poplar puts forth

suckers in great abund-auce.
67. Chaoniique patris glandes] See
the note on ver. 8. of the first Geor-
L gick.
