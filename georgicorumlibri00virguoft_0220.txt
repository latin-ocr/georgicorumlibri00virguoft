189. Filicem] There are several
sorts of filex or Fern. 1 take that of

he quotes of this very passage: “ Vir-
“ gilius et qnaefilz'ccm ferat non im-
“ probat vitibus.”

191. Vites] In the King's ma-
nuscript it is vires.

192. Fateris libamus et auro.] It
is agreed by the Grammarians, that

which the Poct speaks to be our fe· pateris et (mro is the same with aureis
male Fern, or make, which covers pateris.

most of the uncnltivated,
grounds in Italy.

Masvicius has silicem for filicem,
whether by defflgn, or by an error of
the Pffss, Ι am not sure. This read-
ing however is not without some
foundation ; for Columella says flints
are benefici-<tl to vines : “ Est autem,
“ ut mea fert opinio, vineis amicus
“ etiam silex. cui superpositum est
“ modicum terrenum, quia frigidm,
“ et tenax hum-»ris per ortum cani-
“ cnlae non patitur sitire radiccs.''
Palladius also uses almost the same
words. And Mr. Miller observes
that ‘⁶ the land which abounds with
‘⁶ Fern is always very poor and unfit
“ for vines: but the flinty rocks
‘⁴ which abound in Chianti are al-
“ ways preferred, and the vines there
“ produced are esteemed the best of
“ Italy.'’ ssnt I take filicem to be

193. Pinguis T yrrlzenus] The
antient 'fuscans were famous for in-
dulging their appeffles, which made
them generally sat3 thus Catullus
also calls them obesus Etruscus. Or
perhaps he might allude to the bloat-
ed look of those, who piped at the
altars, as we commonly observo of
our trumpeters. ‘ ·

194. Paucas] Some interpret this
hollozc, others bendiug‚ which seems

the more poetical expression: Thus
Mr. 13——

“ And massy chargers bending with
‘⁶ their loads.''

In one of Dr. Mead's manuscripts it
is patulis, which word seems to have
crept into‘the text from some mar-
ginal comment.

195. Studium vitulosque] In one
of Dr. Mead's manuscripts it is stu-
dium est vitulosque.
