Invitent croceis halantes floribus horti ,
Et custos furum atque avium cum falce saligna 110

Hellespontiaci servet tutela Priapi.

Ipse thymum pinosque ferens de montibus altis

Tecta serat late circum, eui talia curae3

Ipse labore manum duro terat3 ipse feraces

Figat humo plantaS, et amicos irriget imbres.
Atque equidem, extremo ui jam sub fine laborum

Vela traham, et terris festinem advertere proram 3

ncid:

“ —— Ubi primum vellere signa

‘⁶ cere castris.'’

109. Crocez‘s halantes floribus Ιιον.
tel] Saffron flowers seem to be put
here sor odorous flowers in general.

In one of the Arundelian manu-
scripts there is olentes instead of lla.
lantes.

111. Hellespontiaci servet tutela
Priapi] The Poet does not mean
that a statue of Priapus should be set
up to defend the Bees : but that they
should be invited by such gardens, as
may deserve to be under the protec-
tion of that deity.

Priapus was worshipped principally
at Lampsacum, a city on the Helle-
3 ont.

p112. Thymum. ] The Thyme of
the Ancients is not our common
Thyme, but the leymus capitatus,

qui Dioscorides C. B. which now
grows in great plenty upon the moun.
taius in Greece. The Attic honey
was accounted the best, because of
the excellence of this sort of Thynis,

which grows about Athens. Thus

our Poet:

‘⁶ Cecropiumque thymum.’'

That also of Sicily was very famous,
to which Virgil also alludes in the
seventh Eclogue:

(ί Nerine Galatea thymo mihi dul-
“ cior Hyblae.” ·

This sort of Thyme has a most sra-
grant smell and agreeable taste3
whence the Poet justly ascribes the
fragrance of honey to this plant:

(ζ — -— Redolentque thymo fragran-
“ tia mella.’'

Itis known among us under the name
of tlze true leyme of the Ancz'ents.

116. Αίᾳιιε equidem extremo, &c.]
The Poet having mentioned the ad-
vantage of Gai-dens with respect to
Bees‚ takes occasion to speak of them
cursorily3 butin such beautiful term,
that every reader must wish that Vir.
gil had expatiated on this subject.
