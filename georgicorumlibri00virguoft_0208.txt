NOTES.

partibus anni, or, as Fulvius Ursinus
reads, alienis mensibus anui, in much
the same sense. lle is proving that
something cannot be produced from
nothing hy this argument: roses ap-
pear in the spring, corn in summer,
and grupes in autumn. Now, says
he, if these were produced from no-
thing, we should see them rise at un-
certain times, and unusual parts, or
months, of the year:

“ ——— Subito exorerentur
“ Incerto spati0‚ atque alienis parti-
“ bns anni.’'

Trebellius, in the life of Gallienus,
as he is quoted by La Cerda, speak-
ing of fruits being> brought to table,
out of the common seusun, expresses
it by alienis mensibus. “ Fieos vi-
“ 1·ides‚-et poma ex arboribus re-
“ centia semper alienis mensibus prae-
‘⁶ buir.'' The verse, which Mr. B—
quotes- from Claudian, rather eon-
firins the old interpretation. He
speaks of roses blooming in winter,
and the cold months glowing with
unusual grass:
“ Quod bruma rosas innoxia
“ servet,
“ Quod gelidi rubeant alieno gra-
“ mine menses.”

 

That is, the roses blow, and the grass
flourishes in winter, which is not the
usual season. The same author,
speaking of a star appearing at noon,

calls it alienum tempus:

‘⁴ Emicuitque plagis alieni temporis
“ hospes
“ Ignis.'’

Ι ‹lo not understand Dryden's trans-

lation of the line under considera-
tlon ;

“ Αη(1 summer suns recede by slow
“ degree5.’'

May has translated it better:

‘⁶ And summers there in months un·
‘⁴ usual shine.'’

Dr. Trapp's translation is not very
different ε

“ And summer shines

“ ln months not her’s.’'

 

159. Bis gravidae pecudes, bis po-
mis utilis arbos] He tells us the
sheep are so fruitful in Italy, that
they breed twice in a year. He seems
to insinuate the same in his second
Eclogue, where Corydon, speaking
of his great riches in sheep and milk,
says he has no want of new milk ei-
ther in summer or winter:

‘⁴ Quam dives pecoris nivei, quam
‘⁶ lactis abundans. ’

“ Mille meae Siculis errant in mon·
‘⁵ tibus agnae:

‘⁶ Lac mihi non aestate novum, non
‘⁴ frigore defit.'’
