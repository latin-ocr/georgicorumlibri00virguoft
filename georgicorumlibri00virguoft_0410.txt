Tollentemque minas et sibila colla tumentem
Dejice: jamque fuga timid um caput abdidit alte,
Cum medii nexus, extremaeque agmina caudae
Solvuntur, tardosque trahit sinus ultimus orbes.
Est etiam ille malus Calabris in saltibus anguis,

Ν OTES.

Hence it signifies the assiduous alten.
dance of a lover on his mistress, in
the third Eclogue:

‘¹² Ipse Neaeram
(ί Dum foi-ew ‘

Thus aisn, in the ninth AEneid, it
signifies the kecping close of an army
within their trenches:

 

 

‘⁶ - — Non obvia forre
‘⁶ Arma viros3 sed castra sovere.’'

 

In much the same sense it seems to be
used h‹=re,f0r a semones kccping close
to the ground, under the mnck of an
uncleansed sheep-c0te. Resides it is
usual sor serpents to lay their oggs un.
der dung, in order to be hatchvd.
Cape saxa mama] The rapidity of
this verse finely expresses the neces.
sary haste on this occasion, to catch
‘up stones and sticks to encountcr the
serpent. This is one of the many
beautiful passages, which vida has
selected from our poet:

“ At mora si fuerit damno, properare
“ jubelm.

‘4 Si se forte cava extulerit male vi. ζ
“ pera terra

‘⁶ Tolle moras, cape saxa‘manu, cape
‘⁶ robora pastor3

‘⁶ Ferte citi flammas, date tela, re.
‘⁶ pellite pestem.’'

42⁶2. Timidum.] It is tumidam in ¹
the Bodleian manuscript, in the old
Nurenberg edition, and in the Venice
edition, of 1475.

425. Est etiam ille malus, &c.] It
is universally agreed, that the Poet
here describes the ClzersydruS, which i
is so called from χέρσος earth, and
ὕδωρ water, because it ,lives in both
these elements. The form and na-
ture of this serpent are no where so νς
well described, as in this passage οξ ³
ou‘r Poet.

manuscript.

exhausta. Pierius found exusta ffi the η
