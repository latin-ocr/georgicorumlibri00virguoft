Dr. Trapp, think in dumis is put for

Albaque circum lilim] The white
lilies are those, which were most cele-
brated and best known among the
Ancients. Theophrastus speaks of
red lilies only by hear-say: ''Em-sp
δὴ καθάπεξ φασὶν ἔνιοι καὶ ωορφυροῖ ᾖ.
Thus our *Poet celebrates them here

for their whiteness, and also in the
twelfth AEneid:

“—— Mixta rubent ubi Lilia

“ multa
‘⁶ Alba rosa.'’

In the tenth Eclogne hementions
thelargeness of lilics:

(ς Florentes ferulas et grandia Lilia
‘⁶ quassans.’'

This may be meant either of the
flo'vver7 which is very large, or of the
whole plant, which7 according to
Pliny, execeds all other fiowers in
tallness: ‘⁶ Noc ulli florum excelsitas
»εί major5 interdum cubitorum trium-⁷³

This author has given a'n excellent*
description of the white lily, in the
words immediately following. He
says the neck is always languid, and*
unable to sustain the weight of the
body, which elegantly describes the
bending down of the fiower. Itis
of a remarkable whiteness, the leaves
[that is⁷ the petals] being streaked
on the outside‚ growing gradually
broader from a narrow origin, in form
of a cup, of which the brims bend
outward‚ having slender threads, and
saffron summits in the middle:
‘⁴ Languido semper collo, et non
‘⁴ sufficiente capitis oneri. Candor
“ ejus eximius, foliis foris striatis, et
‘⁶ ab angustiis in latitudinem pau.

(ί tenuique filo et semine, stantibus in
‘⁶ medio crocis. Ita odor colorque
‘⁶ duplex, et alius calycis‚ alius sta-
‘⁶ minis, differentia angusta.” By
crocis 1 take this author to mean the
yellow apices or summias,- and by
tenm'filo et semine perhaps he means
the stile and ovary. The lilies were
planted by the old Corycian for the
sake of his Bees: for Pliny men-
tions them among the flowers in
which those insects delight: “ Ve.
