word fors-alcen and contemptible3
which interpretation he contirms by
observing that no land could be more
contemptible, than that which is fit
neither for wines, corn, nor pasture.
Thus also Grimoaldus paraphrases
it, ‘⁶ cui rus erat parvum atque ‹le-

it means hereditary, observing that
relinquere is a word used in making
wills, and contirms this interpreta-

Addison also translates it

Dryden is of the same opinion :

Dr. Trapp follows La Corda:

Virgil's meaning. The old Cory-

could the person here spoken of be
the son osone of those Cilicians, born
in Calabria, because he calls him an

Virgil was writing his Georgics,
