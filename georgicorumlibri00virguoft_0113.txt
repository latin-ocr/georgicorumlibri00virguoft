NOTES.

melia is very copious on this jubject,
in Lib. 12. cap. 19, 20, ΞΗ.. He re-
commends the sweetcst must for this
purpose.- thus (lule-isis no idle epithct
to musti iu this passage.

La Cerda observes that Vale-(m is
never used -by virgil for fire‚· but
when he would express a large sire.
This is certain, that Columella di-
rects the firc to bo gradually increascd
to a considerable hcat.

⁶296. [Dulamtrepz'ali ahena] The
wavc *of the trembling kettle is a
poetic-al expression3 the boiliug of a
pot resembling the waves of the sea.
Pierius says it is trepidis desptcnmt
aiim's in the Roman manuscript, and
trepida· in the Mediccan and some
'other manuscripts. The Cambridge
manuscript has trepidi: in the other
manuscripts which [have consultcd {t
is tepidi. Servius, Heinsius, La.
Cerda, Masvicius, and several good
editors read trepidi. Ruaeus aud ma,
ny others prefer tepidi.

297. At rubicunda Ceres, ὃςσ]
From the mention of works to be
done in the night, he passes to those
which arc to be donc¹ iu thc day tium,
both in summer aud winter: and en-
larges upon the enjoyments of hus-
bandmen in the winter season ε

By rubicunda Ceres thc Poet
means the standing corn, which is of
a reddish yellow, or golden colom,
when ripe.

Succidz'tzcr.] Mr. 13- would fain
read succingitur. ‘⁴ Several copies.

‘⁶ says he, have suesimlitur, but it is
‘² a very impropcr expression to say
‘⁶ corn is herred down: but Ceres
‘⁶ represented by a §heaf of cornis
‘⁶ very poetically said to bc girt or
‘⁶ bouud.⁷' In consequence of this
criticism, he translates this line thus :

‘⁵ But bound {s Ceres at the noon of
‘⁴ heat.'’

I do not find any other authority than
this gentieznaffls conjecture, for read-
ing szeccz'nge'lur. All tho manuscripls
and printed copie-s which I have seen
have succiditur, which signifies ir cut
(lucen. The participle of this verbis
applied by Virgss, in the niuth ΔΈιιείά
to a flower cut down by a plough:

‘⁵ Purpureus veluti cum flos succisus
‘4 aratro ·
‘4 Langucscit moriens.⁷’

Coeslo and it's compounds arc fre·
quently applied by Columella to the
cutting down of hay aud corn. The
title of the. uinetcenth chapter of his
second book is, Qslemaslmodmn succi-
suinsoenum livre-{ari ct condc‘delaeat.
Iu that chapter wc find czcm foenum
