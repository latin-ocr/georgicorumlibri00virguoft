Dulcem ferre cibum, et curvas praebere latebras.
Quae tenuem exhalat nebulam, fumosque volucres,
Et bibit humorem, et, cum vult, ex se ipsa remittit,
Quaeque suo viridi semper se grmnine vestit,
N ec scabie et salsa laedit rubigine ferrum z ’

Illa tibi laetis intexet vitibus ulmos ι

Ῑ113 ferax oleo est: illam experiere colendo,
Et facilem pecori, et patientem vomeris unci.

NOTES

rinus, so called, because it was used
in sprinkling‚ as we read in the-scrip-
tures of hyssop, and grew in places
near the sea coast. The prose au-
thors generally write the name of this
plant in one word, rosmarinus‚ or
rosmarinum: but the Poets commonly
divide it. Thus Horace :

“ Te nihil attinet

 

, ‘⁴ Tentare multa caede bidentium

“ Parvos coronantem marino δ

“ Rore deos, fragilique myrto:
and Ovid, who calls it ros maris:

“ ——Cultus quoque quantus in
‘⁶ illis

‘⁶ Esse potest membris, ut sit coma
“ pectine laevis:

“ Ut modo rore maris, modo se vio-
“ lave rosave

“ Implicet.”

214. Tophus scaber] 1 take this
to be what we call rotten stone. Pliny
says ‚it is of a crumbling nature:
“ Nam tophus scaber natura friabilis
“ expetitur quoque ab autoribus.’'

216. Latebras.]' In the King's
manuscript it is tenebras.

217. Quae tenuem exhalat nebulam,

δῖα] The soil, which the Poet here
describes in the last place, we are told
is fit for all the beforenientioned pur-
poses: for vines, olives, cattle, and
corn.

218. Et bibit] In one of Dr.
Mcad's manuscripts it is quoe bibit.

219. Quoeque suo viridi, δῖα]
Pierius observes, that in the most
ancient Roman manuscript this verse
runs thus :

“ Quaeque suo semper viridi se gra-
“ mine vestit.”

220. Nec] In one of Dr. Mead's
manuscripts it is lzaec, which must be
an error of the transcriber.

221. Illa tibi laetis] ln one of
Dr. Mead's manuscripts it is Illa tibi
in laetis.

222. Olea] So Ι read it with
Heinsius ε and so Pierius found itin
the most ancient Roman manuscript,
and in the Medicean, and another
very ancient one. The common
reading is oleae.

224. Capua] The capital city of
Campania.

Vesevo] ‘¹ Servius is mistaken,
“ when he affirm, that Vesevus is a
“ mountain of Liguria, under the

‘⁶ Alps :
