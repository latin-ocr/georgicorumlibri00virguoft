myrtle bernes·

NOTES,

‘⁶ similisss' says Pliny. But strictly
speaking it means only such fruits as
contain only one seed, which is co-
‘vered at the lower part with a husk,
and is naked at the upper part: thus
the fruit of an oak, which we com-
monly eall an acorn, is properly a.
glans. ‘⁶ Glamlern, sagm Pliny,
(ζ quae proprie intelligitur, ferunt
‘⁶ robur, quereus, esculus, cerrus,
‘⁶ ilex, suber.’'

Stringere] This word signifies
to gather with the hand: thus We
find in the ninth Eclogue ε
“ - - - - Hic ubidensas
‘⁴ Agricolae stringant frondes.”

306. Lauri baccas] Translators
frequently confound the Laurel and
the Bay3 as if they were the same
tree, and what the Romans called
Laurus. 'our Laurel was hardly
known in Europe, till the latter end
of the sixteenth century3 about
which time it seems to have been
brought from Trebizond to Constan-

' tinople, and from thence into most

parts of Europe. The Laurel has
no fine smell, which is a property as.
cribed to the Lam-ns, by our Poet in
the second Eclogue ε

“ Et vos,' ο Lauri, carpam, et te
‘⁶ proxime, myrte,

‘⁴ Sic positae, quoniam suaves misce-
“ tis odores .-

and in the sixth AEneid:

” *f‘deoratzcm Lauri nemum&

Nor is the Laurel remarkable for
crackling in the lire: of which there
is abundant mention with regard to
the Laurus.- Thus Lucretius:

‘⁴ Aridior porro si nubes accipit ig.
‘⁶ nem,

‘⁶ Uritur ingenti sonitu succensa re-
“ pente :

α Laurieomos ut si per montes flam.
·‘ nia vagetur,

‘⁴ Turbine ventorum comburens im-
‘4 pete magno.

‘⁵ Nee res ulla inagis, quam Phoebi

‘⁶ Terribili sonitu flamma crepitante
‘⁶ crematur.⁷’

These characters agree very well with
the Ray-tree,which seems to be most
certainly the Laurus of the An-
cient53 and is at this time frequent
in the woods and hedges in Italy.
'she first discoverers of the Lanrel
gave it the name of Lam-ocerams,
because it has a leaf something like a.
Ray, and a fruit like a Cherry.
