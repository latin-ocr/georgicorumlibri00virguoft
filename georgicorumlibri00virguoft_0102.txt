uion of Epicurus is to he found in his
epistle to Ρ) tlmclcs, preserved by Dio-
genes Las—ttius: 'Eu τοῖς περὶ ‘apua-sm
βιζλὶως δε-’κιυμεῃ ἆ.αιτολὰ; καὶ δύσει,-
viminu χαὶ etnim< nai τῶι loimi- ζ’ςμ-ν,
καὶ κατὰ εἷναψιν ’γενέσθαι δύνασθαι καὶ
κατὰ ccmo. Tho render cannot but
observo how justly this verse express-
es the still silence os the night. Mr.
13—--has been more carcsul to pre-

serve this beauty, thau any other of
the translators :

“ Thero, as they say, or rests the
“ sust, still night.”

⁶249. Aut redit u nohis Aurora]
Here he proposes the contrary doc-
trine: that the sun goes to light an-
other hemisphcre, when heleares our
horizon. This is not inconsistent
with the Epicurean philosophy: for
we sec, in the preceding note, that
Epicurus proposes the other opinion,
only as a possibility: and Lucretius
mentions both opinions:

‘⁴ At nox obruit ingenti caligine ter-
‘4 ras,

‘⁵ Aut ubi de longo cursu Sol extima
“- caeli

‘² Impulit, atque suos efflavit langui-
“ dus ignes

“ Concussos itere, etlabesactos aere
‘² multo:

‘⁶ Aut quia sub terras cursum con-
‘4 vertere cogit

‘⁶ Vis eadem, supra terras quae pertu-
“ lit, orbem.

950. Primus equis oriens afflavit
anhelis] Some interpret this of the
morning 3 as if it referred to Aurora,
just mentioned: but the gender of
primus is a sufficient argument against
this interpretation. I take Sol to be
understood3 as.it must in the fifth
AEneid: where we have the same
words, without any mention of Au.
