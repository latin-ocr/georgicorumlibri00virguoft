1119 air, and clashing of arms, and
rushing of 1101595. Perhaps this was
some remarkable Aurora borealis seen
about that 111119 in Germany. The
learned M. Celsius, Professor of As-
1111110111)Υ at Upsal in Sweden, hus as-
sured me, that in those northern parts
of 1119 world, during the appearance
osan Aurora borealis, he has heard a
rushing sound in the air, something
like 1119 clapping of a hird's wings,
Before 'these phaenomena were so fre-²
quenl amongst us as they now are, it
was no unusual thing sor the common
people 10 take them for armies fight-
ing 111 1119 air.

475. Motibus] The. King’s, and
one of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts, and
Schrevelius read montibus.

47 6. V occ quoque per lucos vulgo ex-
malim silentes ingens] [111119 K‘mg‘s
manuscript it is vulgo est audita.

La Cerda is os opinion that the
mighty voice heard 111 the groves, of
which Virgil 11919 speaks, was 1119
voice of 1119 gods leaving, or threat-
ning to have, 111911· habitations. He
understauds Ovid to mean 1119 same
thing, when he speaks of threatning
words being heard in the sacred
graves:

‘⁴ cantusque feruntur

‘⁴ Auditi, sanctis et verba minacia
‘⁶ lucis.’'

 

He takes this to be farther explained
by a passage in Tibullus, lib. 2. eleg.
5.fl·w¹htere he says the groves soretold
a ign z

‘⁶ Atque tubas, atque arma ferunt
‘⁶ strepitantia caelo

The 11119911111143Γ words, says he, of
Ovid arv -splained by the ssight of
the gods in Tibullus, He strengthens
this ‹rhservation by a quotation from
Josephus’s seventh book of 1119 J ewish
war3 where, speaking of the prodi-
gies, which preceded the destruction
of Jerusalem, he says the Priests
heard a voice in the night-time, saying‚
Lct us go hence.

47 7. simulacra modis pallentia mi.
ris visa sub obscurum noctis] Thus
Lucretius:

‘⁶ Sed quaedam simulacra modis palq
‘⁶ lentia miris.’' v

Plutarch speaks of ghosts walk'ing in
1119 night, before Caesar's death,
Ovid also mentions the same thing?
