Imma] Iluet, to solve the difficulty
ofthe Nile’s being said to flow from
the Indians, has discovered, that the
Ancicnts imagined the source of the
Nile to be in India properly so called,
which doctrine he snpports by a rela-
tion, that Alexander thought he had
found it in India. But this was far
from being a received opinion in Vir-
gil's time. For Strabo informs us,
that Alexander himself was convinced
os his error. When Alexander, says
he, saw Crocodiles in the Hydaspes,
and Egyptian beans in the Ace-
sine, he fancied he had found the
source of the Nile, and prepared a
flect in order to invade Egypt that
way. But he soon found it was im-
possible to put it in execution. For
there are mauy‘ rivers and dangerous
cliaiincls between, and above all the
ocean, into which all the rivers of
india empty themselves, and then
there is Ariana, and the Persian aud

sion to have recouse to so absurd an
opinion, if any did entertain it, since
it is easy to prove that the Ethiopians,
fromswhose country the Nile is al,
lowed to descend, were frequently -
called lndians by the Ancients. Thus
