NOTES.

French name of Medica, and Saint-
ἱῙΞηίι for that of Onohrychz's. The
names by which our English Bota-
nists have called the Medica, are Bur·
gundy Trcfoil, and Medick fodder.
Pliny says it is sown in May} but
Palladius says the season is in April:
“ Aprili mense in areis, quas ante,
“ sicut diximus, praeparasti, Medica
“ serenda est.’' The best manner
os cultivating this usesul plant in
England is described at large by Mr.
Miller, in his Gardener’s Dictionary,
under the article ofM‘eclica.

Patres sulci] Putris signifies rot·
ten or crumblc'ng. Thus we find, near
the beginning of this Georgick‚ pu-
tris used to express the melting or
crumbling of the earth upon a thaw:

‘⁴ Vero novo, gelidus canis cum mon-
“ tibus humor

“ Liquitur, et Zephyro putris se gleba
⁴⁶ resolvit.”

In the second Georgick, it is used to
express a loose crumbling soil, such
as we render the earth by plowing :

“ Et cui putre solum, namque hoc
‘⁸ imitamur arando.’⁷

Perhaps, Virgil may mean, in this
place, a soil that has been well
dunged. Columella says the ground
must first be plowed in October, and
suffered to rot all the winter, and
dunged in the spring: ‘⁴ Locum in
‘⁴ quo Medicam proximo vere satu-
“ rus eS‚ proscindito circa calendas
“ Octobris, 'et eum tota hyeme pu-

“ trescere sinito—Postea circa Mar-
‘⁸ tium mensem tertiato, ct necato.—
“ Deinde vetus stercus injicitO.'’ lu
another place he says pinguis and pa·
tris are the same: ¹⁶ Idem pinguis ac
‘⁶ putris.” And we find the ancicnts
to agree, that the ground was to be
dunged, for sowing Medick. Pliny
says the ground must be well la·
bourcd in autumn and dungcd: “ So-
‘⁴ lum, in quo seratur, elapidatum
“ purgatumque subigitur autumno:
“ mox aratum et occatum integitur
“ crate iterum et tertium, quinis die-
“ bus interpositis, et fimo additos·
Palladius agrees with Pliny, except
with regard to the time of preparing
the ground, which he says is iu Fe-
bruary: ‘⁶ Nunc ager, qui acceptu-
‘⁶ rus est Medicam, de cujus natura,
“ cum erit serenda, dicemus, iteran-
“ dus est, et, purgatis lapidibus, dili·
“genter occandus, Et circa Mar·
‘⁶ tias calendas, subacto sicut in hor-
“ tis solo, formandae suut areae latae
“ pedibus decem, longae pedibus
“ quinquaginta, ita ut eis aqua minis-
“ tretur, et facile possint ex utraque
“ parte runcari. Tunc injecto anti·-
“ quo stercore in Aprilem mensem
“reservemur paratae.’' With us a.
loose sandy soil seems to agree very
well with it.

216. Milio venit annua curm] This
expression of the annual care of mil-
let is used by the Poet to shew that
the Medick lasts many years, Pliny
says it lasts thirty: “ Tanta dos ejus
“ est, cum uno satu amplius quam
“tricenis annis duret.” Columella
and Palladius says it lasts ten τ “ Exi-
