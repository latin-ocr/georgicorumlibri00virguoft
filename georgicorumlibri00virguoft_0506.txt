Theocritus also mentions the beauti-
ful Peneicm sl'empe and Pindus to-
gether:

’H κᾶτοῖ Πενειῷ καλὰ Τέμπεα, ἦ κα-
τοὶ Πίνδῳ.

319. Eoetremz'] Pierius found ex-
tremum in some ancient manuscriptS.

Capua] Some understand this of
the mouth ofthe river3 but that was
near Tempe, where Aristaeus was
supposed to dwell. He forsook the
plains, and retired to the springs of
-the river, and the mountain Pindus.

3⁶21. Mater Cyrene] Virgil makes
Cyrene the daughter of Peneus3 but
Pindar makes her the daughter of
Hypseus, king of the Lapithae, son
of the Naiad Creusa, by Peneus:
Ξυνόν ἁρμόζοισα 9εῷ τε ’γάμον μιχ-
θέντι κούρᾳ θ’ ’Ὑψέος εὖρυξία· ὃς
Amne& ὑπερόπλων τιυτοίκις ἦν βα·

emeth, ἒξ Ὠκεανοῦ γένος ἥρως ἕείκίἐΔ
ρος, ’όν ποτε Πίνδου κλεενναῖς ἐν w‘lv·
χαῖς Ναῒς ἔνφροινθεῗσα Πηνέῑύῦ λέχὲῧ
Κρέοισ’ ἔτικτεν Γαίας θυγάτκξ. Al-
most the whole ninth Pythian ode is
taken up with the account of Cyrene,
of which I shall give an abstract.
This beautiful young lady was edu.
cated by her father, iu the vallics of
Pindus. Her whole delight was in
hunting wild beasts, which greatly
tended to the security os her father’s
cattle. Apollo happened to see her
fighting with a lion, and fell in love
with her, in consequence of which
he carried her into Africa, where she
was delivered of our Aristaeus, and
gave her name to the famous city
Cyrene.

323. Thymbroeus Apollo] Apol'.
lo had this Surname from Thymbra,
a town os Troas, where he ha'd a fa..
mous temple. ”

328. Extuclerat] In the King’s‚
one of the Arundelian manuscripts,
and in some of the old editions, itis

nuscripts it is excuterat.
