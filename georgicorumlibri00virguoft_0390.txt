Ασαίαηίῆἱᾱα chemel] Most editors
agree in reading et Acanthida clami :
but Pierius affirms, that is acalan-
thala in all the manuscripts, which is
admitted by Heinsius and Mas-
vicius. Ι11 1110 King's‚ and in one
of Dr. Mead’s manuscripts, it is
athlanthida; in both the Arundelian
copies, it is athalanticla; in 1110)Ιά
,Nurenberg edition it is achanticla.
Acalantlzz's is seldom to be met with
in authors: Suidas mentions it as
the name of a bird: Ἀκαλανθὶς, εἶδος
ὄρνέου. It is thought to be the same
with ἀκανθῖς, which seems to be de-
rived from ἄκανθα, a priclcle‘, because
it lives amongst 11101115, and eats the
seeds ofthistles. Hence in Latin it is
called carduelis, from carduus, a
this-tle, in Italian cco-dello or cordelli-
⁹20, and is by us a thistlefinch, and,
from a beautiful yellow stripe across
it’s wing, agoldfinch. Some take it to
be a nightingale‚ others a linnet. May
translates it a linnet t

‘⁶ -- -—- Kings-fishers play on shore,
‘⁶ And 111151105 tops are fill’d withlin.

‘⁶ nets store.”
And Dryden :

(ί When linnets fill the woods with
‘⁶ tuneful sound, V

‘⁶ And hollow shoars the halcions
ξ( voice reboundfi

La Corda thinks it is what they call
iu SpaniSh silgzcero‚ and Ruaeus says
it is the chardoneret‚ both which
names belong to the bird, which we
call a gold-finch. Thus also Dr.
Trapp translates it:

(ί -- -- -- The shores halcyone re-

(ί .
“ Αῃεὲυἲὴῖ’5τνο01 goldfinch warbles
“ thro’ the brakes.’'

As the Poet describes the evening by
the singing of this bird, it is not im-
probable‚ that he might mean the
nightingale: but as I do not find any
sufficient authority to translate aca-
lanthis a vzzglztz'tzgale, I have adhered
to the common opinion, in render..
ing it agoldssfinch.

339. Quid tibi pastores, δῖα]
Har-ing just mentioned the care of
keeping sheep and goats within
deors, he takes occasion to digress
poetically into an account of the*
African sheplierds, who wander with
their flocks over the vast desarts‚
without any settled habitation.

Libya was used by the Ancients,
to express not only a part of Africa,

‚adjoining to Egypt, but also all that

division of the world, which is usually
called Africa. It is generally thought,
that the Poet in this place, meant
the Numidians, or Nomades, so
called from νομὴ pastum, who used to
change their habitations‚ carrying
their tents along with them, accord-
