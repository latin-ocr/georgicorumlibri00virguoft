NOTES.

Orator: “ Q. enim Pompeius, non
‘⁶ contemptus orator, temporibus illis
‘⁶ fuit, qui summos honores, homo
‘⁶ per se cognitus, siue ulla commen-
‘⁶ datione majorum est adeptus.”
Livy commends Polybius by calling
him an author not to be despised:
“ Hunc regem in triumpho ductum
‘⁴ Polybius,haudquaquam spernendus
‘⁶ auctortradit.” Longinus also‚when
he extols the sublimity of the style of
Moses calls him no vulgar author:
Ταύτῃ καὶ ὃ τῶν Ἰουδειῖων ἓεσμοὲέτης,
’σῦχ’ ὃ τυχὼν ἆνῆξ, {va-213¹), τῆν τοῦ θείου
&braium κατὰ τῆν α’ξίαν ἐγνώρισε, κᾴξέφ-
meu, ἒυὲὖς ἐν τῆ sio-Con} ’γράψεις ταῖν
νόμων, Εἶπεν ὁΘΑεός7 φησί’. τῖ; γενέσθω
φιῖἱς7 καὶ ἔγένεΊο. ’γενέσθαι γῆ, καὶ Ξγέωετε.
Dr. Trapp, in his note on this pas-
sage, justly observes that it ‘⁶ is a
‘⁶ figure of which we have frequent
“ instances; especially in the holy
“ scriptures. Thus Gen. xxxiv. 7.
‘⁴ Which thing ought not to be done ,-
“ speaking of a great zciclceclness.
‘⁶ And Rom. ii. 28. The most
“ flagrant vice-5 are called things
‘⁴ which ure not convenient.’'

6. Hylas paen] Hylas was be-
loved by Hercules, and accompanied
him in the Argonautic expedition.
But going to draw water he felliu,
which gave occasion to the sablo of
his being carried away by the nymphS.
He is mentioned in the sixth 'Ec-
logne :

“ His adjungit, Hylan nautae quo
‘⁶ fonte relictum

f< clamassent: ut littus Hyla, Hyla,
f} omne sonaret.” ’

He mtm’d the nymph (sor who buc
gods cou’cl tell52)
Into whose arms the lovely Hylas fell,-
Alcides wept in vain for ΙΙ ylas lost,
Hylas in vain resounds through all
the coast.
,Lord Roscoemox,

The loss of Hylas is the subject of the
thirteenth Idyllium of Theocritus.

Latonia Delos] Delos is one of
the islands in the ffilgean sea, called
Cyclades. It is sabled that this island
floated till Latona brought forth A-
pollo and Diana there, aster which
time it became fixed.

7. Hippodameque humeroquePelops
insignis eburno, acer eques] Hip-
podame or Hippodamia was the
daughter of OEuomaus, king of Elis
and Pisa. She was a princess of ex-
ceeding great beauty, and had many
lovers. But it being foretold by an
Oracle‚ that OEnomaus should be
slain by his son-imiaw, he offered
his daughter to him who should over..
come the king in a chamot-rece, his
own horses being begotten by the
winds, and prodigiously swift. But
on the other side, if the unfortunate
lover lost the race he was to be put
to death. In this manner thirty lost
their lives. But this did not discou-
rage Pelops the son of Tantalus, who
was greatly in love with her. He ac.

Δ cepted the dangerous conditions, and

contended with the father. In this
race the king's chau-iot broke, by
which accident he lost his life, and
Pelops gained the victory and his
beauteous prize.
