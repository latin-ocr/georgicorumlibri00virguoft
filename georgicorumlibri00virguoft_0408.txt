Dioscorides says it is the juice of a
sort of Ferulu, growing in Syria, that
it has a strong smell‚ and drives away
serpents with it’s fume3 Χαλςένη ὀπὸς

διώκει. Pliny has almost the same
words: ‘⁶ Dat et Galbanum Syria in
‘⁶ eodem Amano monte e ferula. . . .
“ Sincerum si uratur, fugat nidore
“ serpenteS.'’ Columella also re-
commends the smoak of Galbanum,
to drive away serpenls: ‘⁴ Caven-
“ dumque ne a serpentibus adflentur,
‘⁶ quarum odor tam pestilens est⁷ ut
“ interimat universos: id vitatur sae.
‘⁶ pius incenso cornu cervino, vel
‘⁶ galbano vel muliebri capillo; quo-
‘⁶ rum omnium fere nidoribus prae·
‘⁶ dicta pestis submovetur.”

Graves] Servius reads gravi, mak-
ing it agree with galbcmeo nidore,-
which is not amiss: for the smell of
galbanum is very strong. But the an.
cient manuscripts hare graves, which
is generally admitted by the editors.
And indeed this is a proper epithet
sor the chelydri, on account of their
offensive smell, as will be seen in the
next note.

Chelydros] In the King’s manu.
scri t it is chelindros.

SI.) Isidore makes the chelydros and
chersydros to be the same: “ Chely.
‘⁶ dros serpens, qui et chersydros di.
“ citur, qui et in aquis et in terris

‘⁶ moratur.'’ But the chersydros is
described by our Poet ten lines below.
Lucan also makes the chersydrus and
chelydrus two different sorts of ser-
pents t

‘⁶ Natus et ambiguae coleret qui Syr.
‘⁶ tidos arva

‘4 chersydros, tractique via fumante
“ chelydriff'

The Chelydrus seems to be that sort
of serpent, of which we find frequent
mention among the Greek writers
under the name of Spvz‘roq. Nicander
says the drgyz'nus is called also hydrus·
and chelydrus, and that it has a strong
smell. Galen says the bite of them is
very venomous, and the smell so very
ostensive, that it causes those who at..
tempt to destroy them, to think the
most agreeable smells stinking. AEti-
us says this serpent stinks so griev-
onsly, as even to discover the place
where it lurks. Thus we see that
Virgil might well give these serpents
the epithet graves.

416. Sub immotis praesepibus] Pi.
erius says it is ignotis in the Roman
manuscript3 but he justly prefers
immotis.

Columella recommends in a parti-
cular manner, the diligent sweeping
and cleansing of the sheepcotes‚ not
only to free them from mud and dung,
but also from noxious serpents=
