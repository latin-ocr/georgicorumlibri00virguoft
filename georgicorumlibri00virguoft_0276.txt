W'hat have the gifts of Bac-
chus produced in comparison
os these? Bacchus has been
the occasion of crimes: he
overe-ame the Centaurs raging
nith murder, Rhoetus, Pholus,

lerunt?

but this is no good prooi' neither: for
Pliny says the acorns of the Esculus
are inferior to those of the common
oali: 44 Glans optima in quercu atque
44 grandissima, mox escu10.”

Alma] Servius reads alvo. Pierius
found alveo in the Roman manuscript,
with which he was greatly delighted ε
44 In Romano codice legitur alveo,
‘⁶ quod mirifice plaeet.” Ala-eo is
now generally received.

454. Quid memorandum seque, Sca]
Haring spoken of the great uses of
forest trees, he falls into an exclama-
tion against the vine, which is not
only less useful than those trees which
nature bestows on us without our
care; but is also the cause osquam-eis
and murders. Ile. produces a noted
instance of the quarrel between the
Centaurs and Lapithae. Ovid has
described it at large in the twelfth
book of the Metamorphosis. Piri-
thous, lziug of the Lapithae, had
married Hippodamia. At these nup..
tials Eurytus, a Centaur, being in-
[lamed with lust and wine, attempted
10 ravish the bride: which example
was followed by the rest5 who endea-
voured each to seize upon such young
ladies 'as thoy chose. Theseus rising
in defence os the bride slew Eurytus,
and, the other guests assisting‚ all the
Centaurs were either slain or put to
ssight. ·

455. Culpam] ln one of Dr.·
Mead’s manuscripts it is culpas.

Fui-entes Centauros letho domnia]
4· This passage is generall y explained

⁶⁶ by joining letho with domuit. But
44 it. seems to me that it should be'
44 joined with furentes, as it is said
4 furens ira, invidia, (imore, &m
44 and as Virgil himself says in the
‘⁶ second A'Eneid:

cc„

 

Vidi ipse furentem
44 Coede Neoptolemum.

⁶⁶ And then the meaning is, domuit,
44 he overcame, in the common sense,-
“ as wine is said to overcome any
44 one7 and made them mad to death.
44 In the other sense Virgil would
44 contradict what he said before.
⁶⁶ Bacchus et (ul Culpam causas dedit.
44 How would Bacchus have been to
44 blame, for having punished with
44 death profligate wretches that
44 would hare ravished the bride from
44 her husband ? This wasa just, and
44 not a blameable action, but his
44 blame was his orercoming their
‘⁶ reason, and exciting them to that
⁶⁶ outrage.'’ Rbuss .

We find in Virgil sternere Zetho and
dejicere letho, and therefore l do not
doubt but domme letho might be used.
But what seems to me the strongest
confirmation of Mr. B--’s opinion3
is that we find in ovid, that neither
Rhoetus nor Pholus were Smin, but
that they both ssed:
