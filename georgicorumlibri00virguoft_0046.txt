tet the strong bunocks turn un
ilic rich soil, and let the clods
lie to be baked by the dusty
summer with the hot beams of
the sun. Butit the soil be poor,
11 will besuffieient to turn it up
tightly with a small furrow,
about the rising or Arcturus:
ilie design of the first of these
precepts is to hinder the weeds
from hurting the joyfui corn3
that otthe second is to prevent
the small quantity of nioisture
froin forsaking the barren saud.

Pulverulenta eoquat maturis solibus aestas.
At si non fuerit tellus foecunda, sub ipsum
Arcturum tenui sat erit suspendere sulco:
Illic, officiant laetis ne frugibus herbae,
Hic, sterilem exiguus ne deserat humor arenam. 70 ·

NOTES.

vere noro in the forty-third verse in
this Georgick. He there mentions
the beginning of the spring, as the
season to begin plowing. llere he
is more particular, and informs us,
that a rich soil only is to be plowed
so early, and gives his reason for ik
Pliny lias quoted this passage of our
Poet‚in lib. 18. c, 26. He is there
speaking of what work the husband-
man is to do, when Favonius lie-
gins to blow, which he makes to be
about tlre eighth of February, sooner
or later. “ Interim, says he, ab eo
“ die, quisquis ille fuerit, quo flare
“ coeperit, non utique τι. Idus
‘⁸ Febr. sed. sive ante, quando prae-
“ vernat, sive post, quando hyemat:
‘² post eam diem, inquam, innu-
“mera rusticos cura distringat, et
“prima quaeque peragantur quae
“ differri nequeunt.—Terra in futu-
“ rum proscinditur, Virgilio maxi-
“ me autore, ut glebas sol coquat.
“Utilior sententia, quae non nisi
“ temperatum solum in medio vere
“arari jubet: quoniam in pingui
⁸‘ statim sulcos occupant herbae, gra-
“ cili insecuti aestus exiccant: tum
“ namque succum venturis semini-
“ bus auferunt. Talia autumno me-
“ lius arari certum est.’' Columella
tells us, that a fat soil should be

plowed in February, if the weather
be warm enough to admit of it.
“ Colles pinguis soli, peracta satione
“ trimestri, mense Martio, si vero
“ tepor meli, siccitasque regionis sua-
“ debit, Februario statim proscin—
“ dendi sunt.'’

65. Fortes invertant tauri] This
agrees with what he said before,

⁰‘ Depresso incipiat jam tum mihi
“ taurus aratro
“ Ingemere.’¹

I-Ie advises the husbandman to make
deep furrows in the rich ground,
which he expresses poetically by re-
quiring the bullocks to be strong.

66. M'atztris solibus] Pierius tells
us that in the Roman manuscript it
is matzcrisjrugibm.

67. Sub ipsum Arcturum] Arctu-
rus rises, according to Columella,
on the fifth of September: “ Nonis
‘⁶ Septembris Arcturus exoritur.'’
According to Pliny, it rises eleven
days before the autumnal cquinox,
that is, a week later, than Colu-
mella’s account: ‘⁸ Post eos, rursus
“ Austri frequentes, usque ad sidus
“ Arcturi, quod exoritur undecim
“ diebus ante aequinoctium autum-
“ ni.” In another place he tells
