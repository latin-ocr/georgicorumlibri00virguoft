NOTES.

19. Uncique puer monstrator arao-22]
Some will have this to be Osiris, the
Egyptian deity3 but others, with
better reason, think that Triptolemus
the son of Celeus is meant, who
was taught the art of husbandry by
Ceres. La Corda gives {he following
reasons: 1. It is not probable that
virgil would invoke the gods of the
Egyptians, which he reproaches in
the eighth AEneid. 2. Servius ob-
serves that the Romans had not yet
admitted the Egyptian worship un-
der Augustus· 3. As he im-okes
Minerva and other Grecian gods,
why not a Grecian inventor of the
plough? 4. lt was a generally re-
ceived opinion, that the discovery
os corn was made in Attica. 5.
Pausanias says, that the Athenians
and their neighbours relate that Trip-
tolemus was the inventor of sow-
ing. 6. As Celeus is mentioned in
this very book, it is not probable
that he would omit tho mention of
his son.

20. Ec teneram ab radice fi’rens,
Sykam, cupressum] Sylvanns is the
god of the woods. Achilles Statius,
in his commentary on Catullus, tells
us, that on ancient coins and metr-
bles, Sylxanns is represented bearing
a cypress—tree plucked up by the
mets, which sully explains this pas-
sage, Mr. 13- seems not to have
ἔξειὲ aware of this, when he trans-

te 1t;

“ And you, Sylva11u⁸‚ with your
“ cypress ὂοιιὲςῆ]1

Sylvanus is described in a different
manner, by our Poet‚ in bis tenth
Eclogue:

“ Venit et agresti capitis Sylvanus
“ honore,

‘⁶ Florentes ferulas et grandia lilia
‘⁴ quassans.’'

But in the Georgicks‚ where the
Poet speaks of trees, and designedly
omits flowers‚ it was more proper to
distinguish Sylvanus by his cypreSS.

21. Dique Deoeque omnes] Having
invoked 1he particular Deities‚vhe
concludes with an invocation of all
the rest. This is according to the
custom of the priests, who used, after
the particular invocatum, to invoke
all [he gods in general. Fulvius
Ursinus says he saw a marble at
Rome with this inscription:

NoMioic orme
rorAIOC
MAIOP
ANTONINOC ⁸

La Cerda mentions several inscrip-
tions αι) all the gods and goddesses in
genera .
