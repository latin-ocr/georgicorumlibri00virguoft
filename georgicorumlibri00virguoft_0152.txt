P. VIRGILII MARONIS

N OT Es,

’ ‘⁵ fuerunt praennntiae.‘’ Before we
part with these prodigies, it may not
be amiss to observe, that it is very
common not only with Poets, but
with Historians also, to introduce
them as attending upon great wars,
and especially upon the destruction
of cities and great persons, Lucan
makes them wait on the battle of
Pharsalia, and ,Iosephus is nofsparing
of them at the destruction of Jerusa-
lem. The wisest men however a-
niongst the ancients had little saith in
them: and only made use of them
to lead the superstitious vulgar. Vir-
gil ,has related them as a Poet, with
a design to {latter his patron Augus-
tus : sor it cannot be supposed that
he, who was not only a Philosopher,
butan Epicurean also, could have
any real saith in such predictions. If
Ilistorians have thought it not un.
beconiing their gravity to make such
relations, surely a Poet may be in..
dulged in making use of popular opi-
niens, ,when they serve to adorn his
work, and ingratiate himself with
those, who have inclination and power
to confer benefits upon him.

489. Ergo inter sese, δια] There
seems to be uo small difficulty, in ex-
plaining what Virgil means, by saying
Philippi saw two civil wars between
the Romans, and Emathia and the
plains of Haemus were twice fattened
with Roman blood. Ruaeus says that
he once was of opinion, that Virgil
alluded to the two battles fought near
Philippi, within a mouth of each
other 3 in the first of which Cassius
was routed, and in the second Brutus.
But that learned commentator gives

up this interpretation3 because he
thinks the fields cannot be said to
have been twice fattened in one year.
He seems to me to give it up on ra.
ther too slight grounds: and Ι cannot
help allowing it as no ill solution of
:the difficulty. It is however very
probahle, that the Poet alludes to the
two great civil wars, the first of
which was decided at Pharsalia, and
the latter at Philippi. This is gene.
rally allowed to be Virgil’s meaning ε
but then the great distance between
those two places causes an almost in..
extricable difficulty. Servius indeed
says that both battles were fought at
Philippi, and makes it a city ofThes-
saly: “ Philippi civitas est Thessa-
‘⁴ liae ; in qua primo Caesar et& Pom.
‘⁶ peius, postea Augustus et Brutus
.“ cum Cassio dimicaverunt.” Some
others, as Ruaeus observes, finding
in Stephanus, that the . Thessalian
Thebes, near Pharsalus, was also call.
ed Philippi, have supposed this to
be the place, where Brutus and Cas-
sius were overthrown. But this is
certainly a mist-ake, for whosoever
rightly considers the account deli..
vered by Historians of that over-
throw3 will find that no other Phi-
lippi could be meant, but that which
is on the confines of Thrace, and by
some authors is placed in Thrace,
and by others in Macedon. Plutarch
plainly describes the march of Brutus
and Cassius from Asia thro’ Thrace,
to the plains of Philippi. There
they were near destroying Norbanus,
who was encamped near Symbolon,
a port of Thrace. He mentions their
being at this time on the coasts of

nassas,
