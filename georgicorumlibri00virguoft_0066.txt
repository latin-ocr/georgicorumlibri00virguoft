149. Deficerent] Pierius say, that
in several very ancient manuscripts it
is deficerant ; but he thinks, not witli-
out reason‚ that deficerent is better.

Dodona] See the note on Chao-
uiam glandem, ver. 8.

151. Robigo] The blight is a
diseasc, to which corn is very subject:
Theophrastus calls it ἔρυσῖἔη. Many
modern writers take robigo to signit'y
smut, which is a putrefaction of the
ear, and converts it into a black pow-
der. But virgil mentions it as a
disease of the stalk: ut mala culmos
esset robigo: and Pliny tells usit is a
disease, not only of corn, but of
vines: ‘⁴ Caeleste frugum vinearum-
“ que malum, nullo minus noxium
“ est robigo :’' and the title of a
chapter in Columellais, Ne robigo vi-
neam vexet. Vari-o also invokes the
god Robigus, to keep the robigo from
corrupting the corn and trees .· “ Ro-
“ biguni ac Floram, quibus propitiis,
“ neque robigo frumenta, atque arbo-

“ res corrumpit, neque non tempes-
“ tive tl(›rent.’'

But smut is a ‹lis-
ease to which vines are not subject.
Pliny informs us farthcr that robigo
and carbunculus are the same: and
his description of the carbunculus
seems plainly enough to belong to
blights. He says the vines are burnt
thereby to a coal; no storm does so
much damage, for that affects only
some particular spots ; but they lay
waste whole countries: “ In hoc
“temporis intervallo res summa vi-
“ tium agitur, decretorio uvis sidere
“ i110,quod caniculam appellavimus.
“ Unde carbunculare dicuntur, ut
“ quodam uredinis carbone exustae.
“ Non comparantur huic malo, gran-
“ dines, procellae, quaeque nunquam
“ annonae intulere caritatem. Α-
“ grorum quippe mala sunt illa: car-
“ bunculus autem regionum late pa·
“ tentium.''

Thistlcs are well known to be very
injurious to the corn. Our common
thistle not only sends forth creeping
roots, which spread every way, and
sends up suckers on, alr! sides z but is

propagated also by a vast numberof ’
seeds, which, by means of their¹

winged down, are carried to a consi-
derable distance. Dr. Woodward has
calculated, that one thistle seed will
produce at the first crop twenty—four
thousand, and consequently five hun-
dred and seventy six millions of seeds
at the second crop. What particular
species of thistle Virgil meant is not

certain:
