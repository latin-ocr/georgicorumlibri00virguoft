NOTES.

(ί decipere solere, seram nunquam,
‘⁶ quin mala sit.”

226. Aristis] See the notes on
ver. 219 and 220. The King‘s, the
Bodleian, one 01⁰ the Arundelian, and
both Dr. Mead’s manuscripts have
avenis, The other Arundelian, und
the Cambridge manuscript have acer-
vis. Pierius says the Roman manu-
script has illusit aristis, and some
others elusit aristis. But he prefers
(wenis, as it is in the Medicean copy,
because avena is a degeneracy of corn.
Heinsius reads aristis: which I take
to be the true reading ε because I do
not find that any ancient writer has
ascribed the growth of wild oats to
the early sowing of corn. Besides
menis avenis, sounds too likea jinglc
to agree with the style of Virgil. It
must be confessed however, that
there is a passage in Tibullus, some-
thing like this, which seems to coun-
tenance the reading of avenis:

ί( Neu seges cludat messem fallaci-
“ bus herbis.’'

5227. Vilcmsaselum] The kidney
beans arc said to have been very com-
mon among the Romans z and therc-
fore the Poetis thought to have given
them the epithet of vile, mean, or
common. Ile might use this epithet
perhaps, because they might be sown
⁸ in any sort of soil 3 as Pliny tells us.
This authortclls us also, that the Ro.
mans eat thu secds in the shells, as'

we do now : ‘⁶ Siiiquae —- faseo.
“ lorum cum ipsis manduntur gra-
“ nis. Serere eos qua velis terra li.
‘⁴ cet ab Idibus Octobris in calendas
“ Novembris.’'

228. Pelusiaca? lentim] Pelusium
is a town of Egypt, which gives name
to one of the seven mouths of the
Nile. He calls the Lentil Pelusian,
or AEgyptian, because the best are
said to grow in that country.

Bootes] This is a northern con-
stellation, neanthe tail of the Great
Bear. Arcturus, as has been already
observed, is a part of this constella-

tion. Thus Aratus:

Ἐξῦπιῦεν δ’ {Mum φέρεται {mam
ἕωκῶς

Ἀρκτοφύλαξ, τόν ‘p' ἀίἲξες ἐπικλεῖ-
ουσι βοώτην,

Οὕνεχ’ ὦμαξαῖης ἐπαφώμενος {Ginai
ἄρκτον

Καὶ μάλα wic ἆξῖἓηλος· §vrb ζώνη δὲ
οἵ ἀυτός

Ἐξ ἄλλων εἰςκτοῧρος ἑλίσσεται ἀμφα-
δὸν εὶς-ἥς.

The time of the setting of Arcturus,
according to Columella, is on the
twenty-ninth of October: ‘⁶ Quarto
‘⁶ calendas Novembris Arcturus vcs-
“ pere occidit.'’ Lotus sce now how
far the other ancient writers agree
with our Poet. As for vetchcs or
tares, Columella mentions two times
os sowing them3 the first for foddcr,

about ilic time of the autumnal eqni-
nox,
