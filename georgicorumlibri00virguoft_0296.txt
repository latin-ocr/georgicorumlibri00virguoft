NOTES.

‘⁶ iu the ablati-re case. For he does
‘⁶ not mean that other poems are
‘⁴ now grown common, but all other
“ subjects, which might be treated
‘⁶ in verse, and are the usual themes
(ί of Poets. Vv'hat these are he im-
‘⁶ mediately recites.'’ Prmzms.

Fulvius Ursinus observes, that
virgil alludes to particular authors,
who had treated severally of these
sables. Homer has related the fable
of Eurystheus in the eighteenth Iliad.
The Busiris of Mnesimachus is quo..
ted in the ninth book of Athenaeus.
Theocritus has spoken of Hyla53
Callimachus is referred to in Latonia
Dolor, and the first Olympio ode of
Pindar is to be understood by the
mention of Hippodamia and Pelops.

4. Omnia jam vulgata] In the
Bodleian, and in one of Dr Mead’s
manuscripts, it is onmia sunt vulgata.

Eurysthea duram] Pierius says
some would read dirum, but dicrum
is the true reading. Dr. Trapp how-
ever has translated these words,
Eurystheus dire.

Eurystheus the son of Sthenelus
was king of Mycenae, and, at the
instigation of Juno, imposed on Her-
cules his twelve famous labours,
which he hoped would have over-
power-ed him.

5. lllauclali Busiridis aras] Bu-
siris is generally said to have been the
sonos Neptune, king of Egypt, and
a most cruel tyrant. He used to sa..
critice strangers, but Hercules over-
came him, and sacrificed both him

and his son on the same altars. Diod
dorus Siculus tells us, that this cruelty
of Busiris was a fable invented by the
Greeks, but grounded on a custom
practised by the Egyptians of sacri«
ficing red-haired people to the manes
of that king, because Typhon, who
slew him, was of that colour. Sir
Isaac Newton makes Busiris to be
the same with Sesac, Sesostris, and
the great Bacchus3 and adds, that
‘⁶ the Egyptians before· his reign
‘⁶ called him their Hero or Hercules⁷3
‘⁶ and after his death, by reason of
‘⁶ his great works done to the river
‘⁶ Nile, dedicated that river to him,
‘⁶ and deified him by it's names Sikor,
‘⁶ Nilus, and Egyptus; and the
‘⁶ Greeks hearing them lament O Si.
‘⁶ hor, Βοιι Sikor, called him Osiris ·
‘⁶ and Busiris.” The same great
author places the end of his reign
upon the fifth year of Asa, 956 years
before Christ. Eratosthenes, ‚as he is
quoted by Strabo, affirms not only
that this sacrificing of strangers was a
rabie, but that there never was a king
or tyrant named Busiris.

ln the next place let us consider
the objection which the ancient'
Grammarians have made to the use
of the word illaudati in this place:
Aulus Gellius tells us they said it
was a very improper word, and not
strong enough to express the detesta«
tion of so wicked a person, who, be. -
cause he used to sacrifice strangers ot·
all nations, was not only unworthy of

walse, but ought to be detested ang
curse
