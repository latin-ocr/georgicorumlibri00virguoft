GEORG. LIB. l, ’ 33

Deinde satis fluvium inducit, rivosque sequentes?
Et cum exustus ager morientibus aestuat herbis,
Ecce supercilio clivosi tramitis undam

Elicit: illa cadens raucum per laevia murmur
Saxa ciet, scatebrisque arentia tempsrat arva. 110
Quid, qui, ne gravidis procumbat culmus aristis,
Luxuriem segetum tenera depascit in herba3

and then brings down rins of
water over it? And when the
parehed field lies gasping with
‹lying herbs, behold he (lraws
down the water from the brow
of a hill by descending chan-
nels: the water, as it fans,
makes a hoarse murmur along
the smooth stenes, and refresh-
es the thir-Sty fields with it‘s
bubbling streamS. Why should
l speak of him, who, lest the
heavy ears should weigh down
the stem, feeds down the luxu-
riant corn in the tender blade,

NOTES.

sterilis in this place, but that it signi-
fies male, intempestive, etfrustra com-
pacta et conglobata. He observes that
arena is often put for any sort of
earth, as in the fourth Georgick it is
used for the mud of the Nile, which
is fat:

‘⁴ Et viridem AEgyptum nigra foe-
‘⁴ cundat arena.'’

But however it is certain that male
joined with an adjective has the sanie
signification with non. Thus in the
second AEneid, statio male fida cari-
nis is the same as nonfida5 and in the
fourth AEneid, alloquitur male suna
sororem is the same as insana or non
sana: therefore male pinguis in this
passage may well be interpreted non
pinguis, notwithstanding what Ruaeus
has said to the contrary.

106. Deinde satis fluvium, Asa]
Virgil is thought in theselines to have
imitated the following passage of

Homer, in the 21st Iliad:

ιΩ δ’ 01 ⁵ ⁵ x ι x ι x ,Ι ,
ς οτ ανηρ οχετηγος mro κρηνης μελα-

Ἀμφυτὰ καὶ κῆπες ὕδατος ῥόον ἡγεμο-
νεύει,

Χερσῖ μάκελλαν ἔχων, ἀμάρης δ’ ἐξ ἔχματα
βάλλων.

ΤΞ μέν τε προρέοντος, ὑπὸ ψηφῖδες ἅπα-
σαι

Ὀχλεῢνται, τὸ δέ τ’ οἶκοι κατειζὸμενον κε-Ἰ

“ So when a pensant to his garden

“ brings

Soft rills of water from the bub—
“ bling springs,

And calls the floods from high, to
“ bless his bow'rs,

And feed with pregnant streams

Swift o’er the rolling pebbles, down

Louder and louder puri the falling

And shine in mazy wand'rings o’er
