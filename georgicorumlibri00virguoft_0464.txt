of kings: and returning home
late at night, loaded his table
with unbought dainties. He
was the first to gather rnses in
the spring, and fruits in au-
tumn:

of it, one full of leaves, which is
called the female, and the male with
fewer leaves. The branches of both
are many⁷ slender, a cubit long, and
angular. The leaves are like those of
the oak‚ but smaller, narrower7 and
more deeply divided. The {lower is
glaucous. The root long and slender.
It grows in watry places. Some do
not distinguish them, reckoning only
one sort, because both of them have
the same effects: ‘⁶ Nulla tamen Ro-

in incantations‚ to which the Poet
alludes in the eighth Eclogue:

“ Effer aquam„ et molli cinge haec

It was thought to be good against scr-

pents and venomous bites7 and was
recommended as a sovereign medicine
for a great variety of diseases.

131. Premens] Ithas been obser-
ved, in the note on book II. ver. 3 ⁷16,
that virgultapremere properly signi7
fies the increasing of a plant by layers.
But here premens must be understood
of planting in general. Dryden
seems to understand it brai-ring.

‘⁶ Yet lab’ring well his little spot of
‘⁶ ground,

‘⁴ Some scatt'ring pot-herbs here and
‘⁶ there he found.

‘⁶ Which cultivated with his daily
‘⁶ care, ’

‘⁶ And bruis’dwith Vervain, were his
“ srugal fare,

‘⁶ Sometimes white lilies did their
‘⁶ leaves afford⁷ ,

⁶⁶ With wholesom poppy-flower57t0
(ί mend his homely board.’'

This whole passage is erroneously
translated3 for the Poet does not
speak of bruis-ing Vervain, but of
planting it. The Vervain and Lilies
do not 'seem to have been planted for
pot-herim, but the Vervain for medi-
cinal uses, and the Lilies for the Boos:
nor were the Lilies planted sor the
sake of their leaves, but of their
nowers. The Poppies also were not
planted for theirflowers, but sor their
scens.
