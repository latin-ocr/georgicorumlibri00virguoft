GEORG. LIB. 111.-

Et canibus leporem, canibus venabere damas.-
Saepe volutabris pulsos sylvestribus apros 411
Latratu turbabis agens, montesque per altos
Ingentem clamore premes ad retia cervum.
Disce et odoratam stabulis accendere cedrum,
Galbaneoque agitare graves nidore-chelydros.

with dags you will hunt the
hare and hind« Oftentimes also
with the barking os your dogs
you will rouze the wild boar
from his muddy habitations:
and with their noise drive the
vast stag over the lofty moun-
taius into the toils. Learn also
to burn the odorous cedar iu
your solds, and to drive away
tlte stinking chelydri with the
strong smell of galbanum„

cenas, that he preferred the colts of
the] tarne ass to those of the wild one:
*⁶⁶ Pullos earum epulari Maecenas in-

‘⁶ stantibus sapore, Africa gloriatur,
‘⁶ quos lalisiones appellant.” Virgil
-has been censured for mentioning the
hunting of these animals, of which
·there were none in Italy. Varro in-
¹deed seems to speak as if there was
· no sort of asses in Italy, except the
tame: ‘⁵ Alterum mansuetum, ut
'“ sunt in Italia omnes.’‘ But, as we
have just now been told that Maece-
nas preferred the flesh of the tame ass
to that of the wild one, we may con-
clude, that the wild asses were iu
Italy in Virgil's time,

41 1. Volutabris] Thisword proper-
ly signifies the muddy places in which
the swine delightto roll. Thus Varro:
“ Admissuras cum faciunt, prodigunt

'“ in lutosos limites, ac lustra, ut vo-
“ lutentur in luto, quae est illorum
‘⁶ requies, ut lavatio hominis.”

414. Disce et odoratam] The Poet

*now proceeds to shew the injuries to
which cattle are subject: and begins
'with a beautiful account of serpents.

odoratam cedrum] Ι have observed
already, in the note on book II.
ver. 433. that the Cedat· of the
Greek and Roman writers is not the
Cedar of Lebanon, but a sort of
Juniper. Thus May translates this
passage:

‘⁶ But learne to burne within thy
‘⁴ sheltring roomcs
‘⁶ Sir-eet Juniper.''

This tree was accounted good to drive
away serpents with it's smoak. Pal.
ladius says that serpents are driven
away by burning cedar, or galbanum,
or women’s hair, or hart’s horus:
“ Propter serpentes, qui plerumque
‘4 sub praesepibus latent, cedrum,
‘⁴ vel galbanum, vel mulieris ca-
“ pillos, aut cervina cornua frequen..
‘⁶ ter uramus-’‘

415. Galbaneo nidera] Galbanum
is the concreted juice of a plant
called Fcrula. It is probably taken
from more than one species. Herman,
in his Paraclz'sus Batavus, has given
us a figure and description of a plant,
under the name of Ferula Africana
Galbanzfercc, ligustici foliis et facie,
which being wounded yieldsajuice in
all respects agreeing with the Galba-
mem. ‘⁶ Acredine aromatica sat pe.
‘⁴ netranti gustantium linguam pen,
‘⁴ stringit. Sauciata lac fundit vis.
