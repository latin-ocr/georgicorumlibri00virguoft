which was destroyed by an earth-
quake3 but the latter is still remain-
ing, and now called Lago d‘ Averno.
Augustus Caesar made a hav-fn of
them, to which he gave the name of
his predecessor Julius3 as we are in-
formed by Suetonius: ‘⁶ Portum Ju-
“ lium apud Baias, immisso in Lu-
“ crinum et Avernum lacum mari,
“ effecit.’' This great work seems to
have been done about the time that
virgil began his Georgicks. We
may gather the manner, in which
these lakes were converted into a
haren, from Strabo the Geographer,
who, as well as our Poct‚ lived at
the time when it was done. He
ascribes the work to Agrippa, and
tells υς, that the Lucrino bay was
separated from the Tyrrhene sea
by a momul, which was said to have
been made by Hercules: but as the
sea had broken thro' it in several
places, Agrippa restored it: ‘O ἑὲ
Λοκρῖνος κᾶλπος πλατύνεται με’χξι Bana-2,

find this great work consisted chiefly
in forming moles, to secure the old
bank, and leave no more communica-
tion with the sea, than was conveni-
ent to receive the ships into the har-

to secure the bank. This is what
the Pom means by the moles added to

just now, in Suetonius, that Augus-
tus gave it the name of the Julian
part. it romain< now, that we ex-
plain what the Poet means by the
Tusccm tide being let into the Avernicm
sti-eigins. We find in Strabo, that
the lake Avernus lay near the Lu-
crine hay, but more within land:
Ταῖς δὲ Biha: συνεχὲς ὅ τε Λοκῐῖγος κόλπος,
Hence it seems
probable‚ that a cut was made be-
tween the two lakes, which the Poet
calls the streights of Avernus. Phi-
lmgyrius, in his note on this passage
of Virgss, says a storin arose at the
time when this work was performed,
to which Virgilseems to allude, when
he mentions the raging of the sea on·
this occasion :
