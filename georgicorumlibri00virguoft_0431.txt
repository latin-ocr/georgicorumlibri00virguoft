Littore in extremo, ceu naufraga corpora, fluctus

Thucydides says the Physicians at
first could be of no service to the
sick, because they did not know the
nature os the distemper, but died
themselves above all others, be-
cause of their greater communica-
fion With the sicli: ’Όυτε ’γαῖς ἰατροὶ
ἤρκουν τὸ »affirm θεραπεύονΊες οἷ’γνοίᾳ,
ἄλλ’ αὐτοὶ palmula ἔθνησκον ὅσῳ καὶ
μείλια-Ἴσι προσῆεσαν, οὔτε ἄλλη &Ssu-
mia ὀτέχιη οιῖὃεμῖα. And afterwards
he says, those who were taken care
of, and those who were not, died
alike: that there could be found no
remedy that was of service: that
what did good to one did barm to
another: ’Ἔθνῃσκον δὲ, οἱ μὲν, α’με-
λεῖᾳ, οἱ δῖ καὶ πάνυ θεραπευόμενοι.

also Lucretius :

And again,

‘⁶ Nec ratio remedi communis certa

Thus also ΜΓ. Bates, in the ac-
oount above mentioned, says, ⁶⁶ se..
