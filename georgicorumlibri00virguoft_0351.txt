NOTES.

the typha, which we call cam-tad, markablyclearspythe negative quality
or reeca-mace. It is a very common of not having any ulva in it:

weed with us, and in Italy also,
in stagnant waters: it grows to a
considerable height, and bears a head
at the top of the stalk, which when
ripe affords· a great deal of down.
In the passage now under considera-
tion, it is called a marshy plant,
‘⁶ ulvamque palustrem.‘’ In the
eighth Eclogue itis described as grow-
ing near a rirulet:

‘⁶ Propter aquoe rivum viridi pro.
⁶⁶ cumbit in ulva.”

In the second s'Eneid Sinon mentions
his lying hid amongst the ulva, in a
muddy lake:

⁶⁶ Limosoque lacu, per noctem, ob.

⁶⁶ scurus in ulva,
⁶⁶ Delituz'.’'

The cat’sdail‘grows only where there
is mud, and is tall enough to conceal
any person. In the sixth ,Eneid it is
represented as growing by a muddy
river’s side, and the colour is said
to be glaucous, or blueish green,
, which agrees also with the cat's-tail τ

⁶⁶ Tandem trans flaviam incolumes
⁶⁶ vatemque virumque

(ί {asor-mi limo, glaucaque exponit in'
‘ ulva-'²

Ovid makes frequent mention of the
ulva, as a marshy plant. In the
fourth book of the Metamorphosis,
a pool is described as being re-

 

⁶⁶ Videt hic stagnum lucentis
⁶⁶ ad imum .

⁶⁶ Usque solum lymphae: non illic
⁶⁶ canna palustris,

⁶⁶ Nec steriles ult-ce, nec acuta cus-
⁶⁶ pidejunci.'’

In the sixth book, it is called de..
light-*ful to the marshes .-

⁶⁶ --— Agrestes illic fruticosa lege-
⁶⁶ bant

⁶⁶ Vimina cum juncis, gratamque
‘⁶ paladibus ulvam.”

XVe find it mentioned also as a water
plant, in the eighth book ε

‘⁶ Tenet ima lacunae

⁶⁶ Lenta salix, ulvaeque leves :''

 

And in the fourteenth:

⁶⁶ Laeva de parte canori

⁶⁶ :Eolidae tumulum, et loca foeta
⁶⁶ palustribus ulvis ’

“ Littora Cumarum, vivacisque an„a
‘² tra Sibyllae

⁶⁶ Intrat.'’

 

In the eighth book, he speaks osa bed
being made os the ulva:

‘⁶ In medio torus est de molli.
⁶⁶ bus ulvis

⁶⁶ Impositus lecto, sponda, pedibus,
⁶⁶ que ‘salignis”

 

This agrees with what Matthiolus

tells 115, 11131 the poorer pcopllet {n
