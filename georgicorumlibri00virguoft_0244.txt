places, if they be not subject to be
infested with the east and south winds,
as on the sea coast of Baetica: in
which case, he says, they are better
opposed to the north, or west: “ Caeli

29 9. Neve inter viles corylum seren]
ln the King'sjmanuscript it is corylos.
The hazle has a large, spreading
root, which would therefore injure
the vines. This seems to be the rea.

son os roasting the entrails of the goat
on liazle spits, as we find in this
Georgick:

‘⁴ Et ductus cornu stabit sac-er hir.
‘² cus ad aram,

‘⁴ pinguiaque in verubus torrebimus
‘4 exta colurnis.”

The goat was sacrificed to Bacchus,
because that animal is highly injurious
to vines: and it’s entrails were roasted
on hazie spits, because that plant is
also destructive to a xineyard. The
hazle was used to bind the vines. See
the note on rubea, Book Ῑ. ver. 266.

Neveflagella summa peta] virgil
is generally understood to mean by
flagella sunnam the topmost shoots of
the Περι but these are mentioned in
the words immediately following.
Most of the translators therefore have
blended them together. I take sum..
maflagelc'u to mean the upper part of
the slzcot, which ought to be cut off,
ancl is not worth planting, as Mr.
Miller iias observed: “ You should
‘4 ahvaz-s make choice of such shoots
‘⁴ as aire strong and well ripened of
“ the last year's growth. These
‘⁴ should be cut from the old vine,
“ just below the place where they
‘⁶ were produced, taking a knot of
“ the two year’s wood, which should
‘³ be pruned smooth: then you should(
“ cut off the upper part oftke shoot, ν
‘³ so as to leave the cutting about six-
“ teen inches long. Now in making
