We have a passage not much un-

513. Agricola ineam-05 &C.] In
opposition to au these vexations and

sollicitudes the Poet tells us the hus‹
bandman has only the labour of plow-
ing, which supports his country and
his own family. And, to recom-
pense his labours, there is no part of
the year which does not produce
something to his benefit. To crown
all he tells us he is happy in a virtu-
ous wife and dear children: heis de-
lighted with the sight of his cattle;
and diverts himself with rural sports
on holy days.

519. Venit hyems] Mr. 13—-
will have hyems, in this place, not to
signify the winter, but a storm. The
time of gathering clivosis in winter.
Columella says the middle time of
gallie-ring them is the beginning of
December: ‘⁶ Media est olivitas
‘² plerumque initium mensis Decem.
‘⁶ bris.” The same author places
the beginning of winter on the ,ninth
of November: ‘⁴ Quinto [dus No.

dius places the making of oil undet·
