244. Maximus hic flexu, ἔξω]
These lines also are an imitation of
Aratus:

Τοὲς δὲ δῖ εἶμφοτέρεις, gin ωστοιμοῖο α’ποξ-
ἑῶξ,

Ἐῖλεῖται μέγα θαῦμα, δράκων, περί τ’

This description of the Dragon wind-
ing, like a river, at the north pole,
between the two Bears, is no less just
than beautiful. One of the Arun-
delian manuscripts has labitur.

246. Arctos Oceani metuentes oe-
qaecore tinga] ⁶⁶ I beg leave, says
⁶⁶ Mr. B—--, to suppose, that this
⁶⁶ line cannot be of Virgil’s writing,
‘⁶ but that it is slid into the text from
⁶⁶ the marginal note of some Gram-
⁶⁶ marian or other. There is'such a.
‘⁶ jingle betwixt orcam· and tingi,
⁶⁶ and the sense, is any senseat all
“- cau be affixed to it, is so forced,
‘⁶ that it seems to me notin any wiso
⁶⁶ to belong to the author of the
⁶⁶ Georgicks.'' For my part, Ι see
no reason to question the authoritv
os this verse: nor is it left out in au'v
manuscript, or printed edition, that‘l
have seen. Virgil, no doubt, had in
⁷ his view Ilomer's description of t'ne

northern constellations on the shield
of Achilles3 to which he has moro
than once alluded:

Πληϊάδας 27', ὑάδας τε, τό τε σθένος
Ὠρίωνος.

’Ἄρκτον θ’, ἣν καὶ ἅμαξαν ἐπίκλησιν κει-

λέουσιν,

’Ἡτ’ ἀυτοῦ ςρέφεταιῖ, καί ’τ’ Ὠρίωνα ἓν
nibil·

0ὶή δ’ ozia-prof& ἒῖι λοετμῖῗν mummii».

⁶⁶ The Pleiads, Hyads, with the nor-
⁶⁶ thern team3

‘⁶ Anca} {geg-Orion& more refulgent

⁶⁶ To‘wllich,'around the axle of the

⁶⁶ The 15)ξὲιῖ revolving, points his gol-
‘⁶ den eye,

‘⁶ Sti‘n slsstilres exalted on th’ aetherial

⁶⁶ Nor Ihathe's his blazing sorehead iu
⁶⁶ the main.''

Mr. Pom:-

One of the Arundelian manuscripts
has mergi sor tingi.

217. Illic, ut perhibent, aut intem.
posta silet noan] Virgil alludes, in
this passage, to that doctrine of Epi-
curus, that the sun might possibly re-
vive and perish every day, if which
opinion be admitted, there can be no
Antipodes, nor can the sun go to
light another hemispherc. This opi-

uzon.
