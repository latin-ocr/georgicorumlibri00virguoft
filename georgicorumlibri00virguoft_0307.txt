the son of AEneas was called Asca-
nius, or Iulus, from whence the Julian
family derived their name.

36. TrojaeCynclzz'us auctoru] Apollo
was born in Delos, where is the
mountain Cynthus. Heis said tohave
built Troy, in the reign of Laomedon,
In the sixth AEneid he calls Dardanus
the founder of T roy:

“ Ilusque, Assaracusque, et ijoe
‘⁶ Dardanus ‹cuct0r.”

And in the eighth:

Dardanus, Iliacae primus pater urbis
‘⁶ et auctor-2²

37. Invidia infelix, Sem] Servius
seems to understand the Poet’s mean-
ing to be, that he will write such great

things as to desen-e 1envy; but at the

same time that the envious shall for-
bear detracting, for sear of punish-
ment in the other world. I rather
believe with La Cerda and others,
that he speaks of those who envy the
glories of Augustus Caesar, of whom
there must have been many at that
time in Rome.

This and the two following verses
are wanting in one of Dr. Mead’s ma.
nuscriptS.

38. Cocyti.] Cocytus is the name
of one of the five rivers of hell.

Tortosqzce Ixionis angues, imma-
nemque rotam] Ixion attempted to
violate June, for which crime he was
cast into hell, and bound, with twisted
snakes, to a wheelwhich is continually
turning.

Pierius says it is orbes in the Ro.
man manuscript, instead of angues:
but this reading would be a tautology,
for the wheel is mentioned in the very
next verse.

39. Non exuperabile saxum. Sisy.
phus infested Attica with robberies,
for which he was slain by Theseus;
and condemned in hell, to roll a
stone to the top of a hill, which al.
ways turns back again, before it
reaches the top. This punishment of
Sisyphus is beautifully described by
Homer:

Kal μὲν Σίσυφον εἷο-εἴδω κρατέρ’ ἄλγε’
ἕχονἾκ,
