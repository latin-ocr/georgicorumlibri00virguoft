NOTES.

290. Pharetrctloe vicinia Perse·-
clim] The Persians were famous for
riding, hunting, and shooting arro ivs.
We are not to understand the Poetin
this place, as speaking of Persia
strictly so called, which was bounded
on the west by susiana and Media,
on the north by Parthia, on the east
by Caramania, and ou the south hy
the Persian gniph, but of the exnpire
of those people extended by Cyrus.
Xenophon tells ns that great monarch
left behind him an empire bounded
on the east by the mare erythrsezcm,
on the north by the Black sea, on
the west by Cyprus and Egypt, and
on the south by Ethiopia: Καὶ ἐκ
τόυτου τὴν α’ρχῆν ὥριζεν αὐτῷ ωρὲς
’ἕω μὲν, ἦ {futhei Scina-572· wilm
ἆρκἾον δὲ, ὅ ’Ἔυξεινος πίνἺος. πρὸς
ἑσπέραν δὲ, Κύπρος ΑἵγυπἽος.
ωξός μεσημςρῖαν δὲ Ἀιθιοπῖσι. Here
then We see plainly how the Nile
may press the borders of Persia,
since the Persians had extended their
dominion as far as to Egypt. The
Poet had before spoken of the west
side of the Delta under the name of
Canopus: and now he expresses the
east side, or Pelusian mouth of the
Nile, as bordering on the empire of
the Persians. Catrou finds seme co-
lonies of Persians seated on each
side of the Upper Egypt, which hc
thinks the Poct means in this verse.

291. Viridem [Egyptum.] Har-
douin thinks the epithet viridis«, ap-
plied to Egypt, is cold and inani-
mated: this belng added to another

observation, that Virgil does not use
to be guilty of such tautology‚ as to
make a double description ofthe same
place, he concludes, that the Poet
must speak oftwo different comunes.
'ihr-u finding mention in Pliny of a
triangular island at the mouth of the
ludus, he ventures to affirm, that
virgil meant this island by viridem
zEgJsptum, because it resembled the
lower Egypt or Delta, in its trian-
gular shape, and that the epithet
viridis is only a translation of Pra-
siane, But viridis is by no means a
cold epithet for Egypt, being very
proper to express the great fertility of
that country, when overssowed by
the Nile. As for the island Prasiane,
Pliny does not say it is triangular. I
do not find any mention osit, except
in the twentieth chapter of the sixth
book, where he says it is a very large
island, and that there is another near·
it named Patale: ‘⁶ Amplissimam in-
‘⁴ sulam efficiens, quae Prasiane no-
‘4 minatur, et aliam minorem quae
‘⁶ Patale.'' As for Patale, he says
in the next chapter, that it is trian-
gular: ‘⁶ Sed ante sunt aliae, Patale,
“ quam significavimus, in ipsis fau-
“ cibus indi triquetra figura ccxx.
‘⁶ M. pass. latitudine-'' ssut he no
where says any thing of its greenness
or fertility. And to me it appears.
a great violence to make Virgil call
two indian islands green Egypt, be-
cause one of them resembles it in‘
shape, and the other is derived from
a G reek word siguifyinggreen3 which
