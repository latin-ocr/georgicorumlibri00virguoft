'‘NOTES.

ίγιον, καὶ ’Ἅρπαγον ὦκεὰς, τέκνον Ποδάρ-
’σγας καὶ Κάλλαρον. Pliny mentions
the charioteers of both the brothers:
‘⁴ Sunt qui conditam eam ab Am-
›“ philo et Telchio, Castoris ac Pol-
‘⁶ lucis aurigis putent.’' From these
quotations I think it appears, that
those are in the wrong, who suppose
Cyllarus to belong only to Castor.
It seems to me, that both the bro-
thers had an equal property in the
horses, and therefore, that they
might as well be ascribed to Pollux
as to Castor. Propertius speaks of
the horse of Pollux, without any
mention of Castor:

‘⁶ Potaque Pollucis nympha salubris
‘⁶ equ0.’'

and others say the horses oi· Mars are
F ear and Terror. Others contend
that these are the companions‚ and
not the horses of that deity. Those
who think they are the horses of Mars,
'seem to have fallen into that error,
by misunderstanding the following
passage in the fifteenth Iliad z

Ὠς maffia· καί ’ᾗ ἵππους κέλεἾο Δεῖμόν τε
Φόξον τε
Ζευγνύμεν’.

I believe they tooli Δεῖμον and Φόξον
to be joined with ἵππους, whereas
they are certainly the names of the
persons whom Mars commanded to
harness the horses, as Mr. Pope has
justly translated it:

‘⁴ With that, he gives command to

Resides, in the thirteenth Iliad, Ho-
mer mentions φόζος, or terror, not
gsslffigtrssthe companion, but as the son

Hesiod, in his Θεογονίᾳ, mentions both
fem· and terror, as the sons of Mars
and Venus:
