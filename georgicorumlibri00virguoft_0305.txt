NOTES.

31. Fidentemque suga Parthum ‘⁶ Of their pursuerS, and overcame

versisque sagittis] The Parthians
used to fly from, their enemies, and at
the same time to shoot their arrows
behind them. T'nus Ovid:

“ Tergaque Parthorum, Romanaque
‘⁶ pectora dicam3

“ qu‘aqligqhsag 1agerso quae jacit

‘⁶ Quid fugis ut qvinhas3 quid victo

‘⁶ Parthe relinques? ²

32. Duo rapta manu diverso es.-
hoste trophaea] Servius will have
this to mean the Gangarides in the
east, and the Britons in the west: but
it does not appear from History that
Augustus ever triumphed over the
Britons, or even made war upon them.
La Cerda proposes another iuterpre-
tation. He observes, that rapta mct-
mc expresses Augustus Caesar’s having
obtained these victories in person.
Now it appears from Suetonius, that
he managed only two foreign wars in
person, the Dalmatian and the Can-
tabrian: ‘⁶ Externa bella duo omnino
‘4 per se gessit, Dalmaticum adole..
‘⁶ scens adhuc, et, Antonio devicto,
‘⁶ Cantabricum. Reliqua per legatos
‘⁶ administravit.'’ Ruaeus under-
stands the Poet to speak of the two
victories obtained over Anthony, the
first at Actium„ a promontory of Epi„
rus, on the European shoar: the
other at Alexandria, on the African
shoar3 and that this is meant by utro-
qzceah littore, in the next verse. Ca-
trou thinks this solution of Ruaeus a.
very judicious one: but yet he thinks
he cau give a more solid explication
of this passage, from Dion Cassius.
This author relates that Augustus
made war twice on the Cantabriam,
and on the Asturiam, and twice in
Asia. He went in person against
the Spaniards the first time they ree
volted, and they were subdued the seu:
