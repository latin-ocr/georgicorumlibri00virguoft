Several of the old printed editions
have jacet instead of licet.

215. Vere fabis satia] I do not
find any of the ancient writers ofagri-
culture to agree with Virgil about
the time of sowing beans. Varro
says they are sown about the latter
end of October: “ fabam optime
“ seri in vergiliarum occasu.’' Co-
lumella says it is not right to sow
them after the winter solstice3 but
that the worst time of all is in the
spring: “ Post brumam parum recte
“ seritur, pessime vere, quamvis sit
“ etiam trimestris faba, quae mense
“ Februario seratur3 quinta parte
“ ampliuS, quam matura, sed exiguas
‘⁶ paleas, nec multam siliquam facit.”
Palladius says beans are sown at the
beginning of November: “ ln hujus
‘⁶ principio'Tabam spargimus.” Pliny

ber: “ Seritur ante vergiliarum oc·
‘⁴ casum, leguminum prima, ut an-
“ teccdat hyemem.'' But Pliny’s
words, which follow immediately,
shew that, in Virgil’s own country,
beans were sown in the spring:
“ Virgilius eam per ver seri jubet,
“ circumpadana} ltaliae ritu.¹' We
find by this passage, that those, who
lived near the Po, did not always sow
at the same. time with the rest of
Italy. llence it is no wonder, if we
do not always find· an exact agree-

ment between our poet, and the other
Latin writers.

Medica] This plant has it's name
from Media, because it was brought
from that country into Groece, at the
time of the Persian war, under Da·
rius, according to Pliny: “ Medica
“ externa, etiam Graeciae, ut a Me-
“ dis advecta per bella Persarum,
‘⁴ quae Darius intulit.” It is of late
years brought to us from Franco and
Switzerland, and sown to good ad-
vantage under the name of Lucem.
Ray affirms, that the Lucem οι· Lu-
zerne of the French is the Onobry-
chis, known to us under the name of
Saint-Foim or, as it is corruptly call-
ed, Cinquefoil: and that the Medica
is called by the French Saiutfoin,
Foin de Bourgogne, and grand Trqffle.
Hence, he observes, appears the mis-
take of our seeds-men and farmers,
who sow the Ouobrycliis, instead of
the BIedica, under the name of Saint-
soin. But I suspect that learned au-
thor was misinformed, because Tour-
nefort has given Luseme for the

French
