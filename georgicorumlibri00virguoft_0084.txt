NOTES.

“ mens( adhuc lini semtn spargi po-
“ terit, usque ad V11.ldus Decem-
“ bris. '' Pliny differs from all these
writers, and says it is sowu in the
spring: “ Vere liuurn, ct avenam,
“ et papaver ;” aud iu another place,
“ Vere satum aestate vellitur.'' The
time of sowing ssax with us is in
March.

Cereale papaver] I have spoken
of poppies at large, iu the note ou
ver. 78. Pliny speaks os sowing
them in the spring, as we have seen
iu the preceding note. Columella
agrees with Vix-gil: “ Chaerephyl-
·‘ lum, itemque olus atriplicis‚ quod
‘⁴ Graeci vocant ἀτράφαιξιν, circa ca-
“ lendas Octobris obrui oportet uon
“ frigidissimo loco. Nam si regio
“ saevas hyemes habet, post Idus Fe-
“ bruarias semine disserenda suut,
“ suaque de sede partienda. Papaver
“³ et anethum eandem habeut condi-
“ tionem sationis, quam chaerephyl-
“ lum et ἀτράφαξις.” Palladius says
the time'of sowing poppies is in Sep-
ternber: “ Nunc papaver seritur locis
“ siccis, et calidis: potest et cum aliis
“ oleribus seminari.”

Many are the reasons assigned by
the commentato-rs for the epithet ce-
reale being added to Papa-cer. Ser-
vius assigns the following reasons:
either because it is eaten like corn;
or because Ceres made use of pop-
pies to forget her grief, and was
throxvn thereby into a sleep, when
she had watched a long time on
account of the rape of Proserpine;
or because Mycon the Athenian,

who was bcloved by Ceres, was
trausformed into a poppy3 or be-
cause it was spriukled upon bread.
La Corda quotes the authority of
Eusebius, in his third book de Proe-
paratione Emugeliw, that Ceres was
aecouuted the inventress of poppies.
Ruaeus has the same quotation: but
1 sear he took it implicitly from La
Ccrda. 1 wish these commentators
had given us the words of Eusebius:
sor Ι cannot find any passage in that
author, which agrees with what they
have said. 1 find, in the third book
of Eusebius, a quotation from Por·
phyry, where he says the statues of
Ceres are adorned with ears of corn,
aud that poppies are added, as a sym-
bol of fruitluliuss Διὰ καὶ κατε ‘renim
το βρέ τσις εἷυτκς τοῖς foi-xum, μηκωνες τε
περι amm τῆς ωολυγονιας σῦμςολω. I a
Cerda gives another leason: that
Ceres relieved her hunger with pop-
pies, as appears from the fourth
book of Ovid’s Fasti. We are there
told, that, when Celeus invited Ceres
to refresh herself iu his cottage‚ his
little boy was sick, and could get
no rest; upon which Ceres gathered
some poppies, to cure him, aud tast-
ed them herself unawares. She de—
elined eating with Celeus, and gave
the poppies to the' boy with warm
milk:

“ Dux comiti narrat, quarn sit sibi
“ filius ae er;
“ Nec capia} somnOS, invigiletque
“ malis.
