nations, which in the most ancient
times dwelled on the east of Egypt,
seem to have been shepherds, as we
may gather from many passages in
the history of Abraham and his de..
scendants. The religion and customs
of these people were very opposite to
those of the Egyptians, who were
often invaded by them. Hence we
find in the history of Joseph‚ that
every Shepherd was (m abomination
to the Egyptians. W hen the children
of Israel departed out of Egypt, the
inheritance which God gave them,
was in the country inhabited by these
shepherd53 who being expelled by
Joshua, invaded the lower Egypt,
easily conquered it, and erected a
kingdom, which was governed by a
succession ofkings of the race of these
shepherds. They were afterwards
expelled by the kings of the upper
Egypt, and fied into Phoenicia, Ara-
bia, Lybia, and other places, in the
days of Eli, Samuel, Saul, and David.

This seems to be the most ancient
account of the inhabitants of Libya;
whom therefore we find to have been
originally shepherds.

l am not ignorant that this system
is contrary to the opinion of some
Chronologers, who make the invasion
of Egypt by the shepherds much more
ancient, and suppose that king of
Egypt, with whom Abraham con.
versed, to have been of that race.
But, as Sir Isaac Newton observes,

it is plain that Egypt was not under ,

the government of the shepherds in
the time of Joseph, but were either
driven out before that time, or did
not invade Egypt till after the depar-
ture of the children of Israel: which
latter opinion seems most probable,
as the best authorities place the time
of their expulsion a little before the
building of the temple of Solomon.

delian, and in one of Dr. Mead's
manuscripts, it is campie.

344. Laremque] It is laboremque
in the Roman manuscript, according
to Pierius, But laremque is certainly
the right reading: for it was custo.
mary with these shepherds to carry
their gods about with them. Thus
we find in the book of Genesis, that
Rachel had stolen her father's gods,
and carried them with her in her
fli ht.
