are Arabia, Syria, &c. all which are
comprehended by the Poet under the
name of Persia, because they were
all subdued by Cyrus, and his son
Cambyses, Catrou proposes a new
solution of this difficult passage. Ile
supposes virgil to mean the whole
course of the Nile, the lower Egypt
in the three first verses, the upper
Egypt in the two next, and the source
of the Nile in the two last, conclud-
ing with ver. 294, which plainly
shews that the Poet intended to de-
scribe only one country. For my
own part, Ι take Virgil, by all that
he has here said, to mean only a de.
scription of the Delta, or lower
Egypt. Canopussis the west angle
of that triangular region, Pelusium is
the east angle, being nearest to Per.
sia, and the south angle is the point,
where the Nileis divided, to form the
Delta. Ι shall endeavour to explain
what has been said, in the following
notes on the particular expressions.

that this city was so called from Ca-

died there, and that it is a hundred

the same author, was accounted the
metropolis of Macedonia, being the
birth-place both of Philip and Alex-

The city Canopus gives name to one
of the most considerable mouths of

which Alexander built in Egypt, and

west side of the Delta, by calling it
the Pellaean Canopus, on account of
the neighbourhood of Alexandria.
