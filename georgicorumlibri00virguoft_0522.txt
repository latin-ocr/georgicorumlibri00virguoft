thee on the solitary shore, thee
when day appmached, thee

NOTES.

461. Rlzoclope'e’oe arcam] Rhodope
and Pangaea aremountains ofThrace.

46⁶2.. Pangaea] Some copies have
Panchaia, but it is an absurd reading;
for Panchaia belongs to Arabia,
whereas Orpheus was confessedly a
Thracian.

Rhesi Mavortia tellus] Mars was
said to be born in Thrace. Rhesus
was the son of Mars, and king of
Thrace in the time of the Trojan
war, which was after the death of
Orpheus,

463. Getta] The Getae were a.
people 'dwelling in the neighbour-
hood of Thrace.

Hebrus] A river of Thrace.

Et Actias Orithyia] Some read
atque instead of et.

Orithyia was the daughter of Erec-
theus, king of the Athenians. She
was ravished by Boreas, and carried
into Thrace.

464. Cava testudine] The Poet
calls he lyre cava testzch, because
the ancient lyres were really made of
the shells of tortoises. It was a re-
ceived story among the Ancients, that
Mercury, finding accidentally a dead
tortoise on the banks of the Nile,
made a lyre of it: whence Horace
calls him czct‘voe lyme parentem. To
this story the same Poet also alludes,
in the eleventh ode of the third book z

“ Tuque, Testudo‚ resonare septem
“ Callida nervis,
“ N ec loquax olim, neque grataz

i‘'indl in the third Ode of the fourth
oo ς :

“ O Testudinis aurete

“ Dulcem quae strepitum, Pieri, tem.
“ peras!
‘⁴ O mutis quoque piscibus

“ Donatura cygni, si libeat, sonum!⁷’

See the Philosophical Transactions,
numb. 282. pag. 1267. Jones's A-
bridgment, Vol. IV. pag. 474.

465. Te, dulcis conjux, 5502] There
is something wonderfully pleasing in
the repetition of te in these lines.
But Dryden has omitted it in his
translation :

‘⁴ On thee, dear wife, 111 deserts all
‘⁶ alone.

‘⁶ He call’d, sigh'd, sung, his griess
“ with day begun,

“ Nor were they finish’d with the
“ setting sun.’'

467. Taenarz'as fauces] Taenarus
is a promontory of Peloponnesus,
sabled to be 1116 entrance into the in·

fcrnal regions.
