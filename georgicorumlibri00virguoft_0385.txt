Vellera mutentur, Tyrios incocta rubores.

were greatly esteemed hythe ladies,
for their delicate softness.

In magno tardentur the Poet allndcs
to the ancient custom of changing
one commodity for another, before
the general use of money.

307. Tyrios incocta ruborem] See
the note on Tyrio conspectus in ostro,
ver. 17.

308. Densior hinc soboles] Colu-
mella'says a goat, if she is of a good
sort, frequently brings forth two,
and sometimes three kids at a time:
‘⁶ Parit autem si est generosa proles,
“ frequenter duos, nonnunquam tri-
‘⁶ geminos.''

309. Quam magis] Pierius says
it is quo magis in the Roman, and
other ancient manuscripts, ’

310. Flumina] So I read, with
Heinsius, and Ruaeus. Pierius says
it is ubera, in the Roman, the Lom-
bard, and other very ancient manu-
scriptS. He seems to think ubera the
true reading3 and that the transcri-
bers, observing ubere in the prece-
ding line, were afraid of repeating
ubera in this3 and therefore substituted
flumina. La Cerda also thinks,
that those who read flumina, depr-ive
this passage of a great elegance. Ἰ
find ubera in the King’s‚ the Βοό-
leian, both the Arundelian, and both
Dr. Moad’s manuscripts. ·In the
Cambridge manuscript, and in most
os the later editions⁷ it is flumina,
which appears to be no inelegant

reading. Pierius also allows that

flumina is a metaphorical hyperbole,

very proper in this place, to express
an extraordiuary abundance of milk.

311. Barbas incanaque menta Ci-
nyphii tondent hiran] Cinyphus, ac-
cording to Strabo, is a river of Africa.
According to Pliny, Cynips is the
name both osa r1ver and a country ι
‘⁶ Augylae ipsi medio fere spatio lo-
“ cantur ab AEthiopia, quae ad oc.
‘⁵ cidentem vergit, et a regione quae
‘⁴ duas Syrtes interjacet, pari utrin-
(ί que intervallo, sed littore inter duas
‘⁶ Syrtes, ccl. M. pass. Ibi civitas
‘⁶ OEensis, Cynips ssuvius ae regi0.’‘
This country seems to be that which
is now called Tripoly, OEa being one
of the three cities, which werejoined
to make the city Tripoli& This coun-
try was famous sor goats with the
longest hair-3 whence these auimals
are often called Cinyphiam· Thus
Martial: ’

‘⁶ Cujus livida naribus caninis

‘⁶ Dependet glacies, rigetque barba,
‘⁶ Qualem forficibus metit supinis

‘⁶ Tonsor Cinyphio Cylixmaritog

And

<⁶ Non hos lana dedit, sed olentis
