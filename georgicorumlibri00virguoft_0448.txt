appear 10 1110, 10 110 coneerning the
plant cer-inme, but to relate to the
efc'fflzace, spoken of already in the
note on ver. 32-3. He says they have,
besides their honey, another sort of
food which some 0311 cerinthum‚which
is not 50 good, and has a sweetness
like that of a fig: ’‘Eo‘la δὲ αὐταῖς
καὶ σιλλη τροφὴ, ἣν καλοῖσι ’τινες
κῆρινθονὶ {sqq} δὲ τοῦτο ὖποὸεὲσἾερῡν, καὶ
“stamen-wrm συκιόὸη ἕχον. NOW Pli-
ny assui-es us that the cerinthum,
which he says is also called sanda.
raca7 is the same with the erithace3
‘⁵ Praeter haec convehitur erithace,
“ quam aliqui sandaracam, alii ce-
Η111111111111 vocant.” Aristotle also
mentions sandaraca in such a man-
1101, that wo may imagine it to be the
same with that which he had before
spoken os under the name of cerin-
thum: for he says itis 3 substance ap-
proaching in hardness to wax, and
serves the Bees sor food: Τροφῇ δὲ
χρῶνῗαι μέλιἾι καὶ θεροῦς καὶ χει.
μῶνοςο villulas δῖ καὶ ἄλλην τροφῆν
ἔμφερῆ τῷ κηρῷ ‘riv σκληρότητα, 3¹
ἒιομαῖζουσῖ ’τηις σαῃὸαρσίκηνι Thus we
see that the cerinthum or sandaraca
of Aristone, is not the name os 311
herb, as La Cerda and others have
imagined3 bnt ef a substance collec-
ted by the Bees, to serve them sor
sustvuunee. Corinth& however is cer-
tainly the 1131110 of an herb, which
grows common in Italy, whence the
Poet calls it ignobile gramen. Theo-
phrastus says 110 inore ofit, than that
ist ssowers in summer. Dioscorides
does 1101 mention it. But Pliny has

given us a description of it. He
says it is a cubit high, it’s leaf white
31111 bending, it's head hollow, and
abounding with 3 jnice like honey3
and the Bees are fond of it's flower:
‘⁶ Est antem cerinthe folio candido,
‘4 incurvo, cubitalis, capite concavo,
“ mellis succum habente. Horum
‘⁴ floris avidissimae sunm There
are several species of Cerinthe de-
scribed by modern authors: but Ι
believe that of the Ancients is the
Cerintho flavo flore asperior C. Β,
or yellowflowereclhoney mort. Itis
one of the most common hei-bs all
over Italy and Sicily. In our gar-
dens it grows to the height of a foot
and a half or two feet. The stalks
are about the thickness of oue's fin-
ger, round, smooth‚ whitish‚ and
divided into several branohes. 'l'he
leaves embrace the stalk and branches
with their bases, and diminish gra-
dnally to a point: they are of a.
blueish colour, marked with white
spots, seton both sides with prickles‚ ”
and neatly indented. The flowers
hang 111 bunches from the tops of the
branches. The empalement is divi--
ded into five segments neatly inden-
ted about the edges: the petal is long,
tubular, and of ayellow colour. The
summits are of a dark 0010111, and
are snstained by yellow chive8‚ each
flower is succeeded by two. seeds.
