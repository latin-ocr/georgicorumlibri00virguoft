remember to unbind and toss
about the bundles ofstraw with
their snoutS. But the mists
descend, and ne on the plain ι
and the owl ohserving thc set-
ting sun from the top of the
roos, forbears to sing her night-
ly song.

Hence they are said to be beloved
by the sea-nymphs. Thus Theo-
critus ε

neqnicqoeum is seldom used by Virgil

for non: bnt here I think it is plainly
used in that sense. Aratus says that
the singing of the owl is a sign of the ·
storms ceasing :

Pliny says the chattering of the owl,
in rain, is a sign of sair weather;
and in fair weather, of a storm:
“ Grues silentio per sublime vo-
(ί lantes [przesagiunt] serenitatem.
‘⁶ Sic noctua in imbre garrula: at
‘⁶ sereno, tc1npestatem.'‘ We have
seen already, in the note 011 ex-
imbres, that the prognosticks here
set down relate to the continuant-e
of fair weather‚ not of its suc-
‘⁶ cceding a storin. Therefore the
silence of the owl is a sign of the
continuance of fair weather. If we
understand the Poet to be speaking
during the rain, the hooting of the
owl will be a sign of fair weather,
according to Aratus· But then Ne-
quicquam must be wrong, whether
we take it to mean noc or in vain.
If we. understand the Poet to speak
of the continuance of fair weather,
nequz'cqumn must signify mut,- be-
cause, according to Pliny, the 11001-
ing of the owl, at sut-h a time would
be a sign of rain. May has translated
