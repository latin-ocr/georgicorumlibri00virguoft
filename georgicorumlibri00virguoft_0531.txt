GEORG. LIB. IV.

Ah miseram Eurydicen anima fugiente vocabat:

 

Eurydicen toto referebant flumine ripae.

Haec Proteus, et se jactu dedit aequor in altum}
Quaque dedit, spumantem undam sub vertice torsit.
At non Cyrene : namque ultro affata timentem ε, 530
Nate, licet tristes animo depellere curas.

Haec omnis morbi causa: hinc miserabile Nymphae
Cum quibus illa choros lucis agitabat in altis,

· Exitium misere apibus.

Tende petens pacem, et faciles venerare NapaeaS. 535
Namque dabunt veniam votis, irasque remittent.
Sed, modus orandi qui sit, prius ordine dicam.
Quatuor eximios praestanti corpore tauros,

Qui tibi nune viridis depascunt summa Lycaei,

Tu munera supplex

ah! poor Eurydice, as his life
deparied, and all the rocks re-
peated hurydice thro‘ the whoie
river. Thus spake Proteus;
and threw himseifinto the deep
sea, and as he went, the water
foamed about his head. But
Cyrene did not plunge into the
sea: for she came and spoke to
her trembiingsom and bid him
lay aside his vexatious carc:-
Hence, says she, is all the
cause of your disaster: hence
the Nymphs, with whom she
was dancing in the thick
groves, have sent a miserabie
destruction on youreees. But
do you in a suppiiant manner
offer gifts, and ask peace, and
worship the savourable wood
Nymphs. For prayers wiii
move them to pardon, and they
wiilrremit their anger. But
first 1 will teli you in order¹ in
what manner they must be iu-
treated. Pick out four chosen.
bulis of the largest size, that
now graze on the summit uf
