Antiquity. Hesiod‚ who lived in the generation immedi-
ately succeeding the Trojan war, wrote a Greek poem on
Husbandry. And though Homer did not write expressly
on this subject, yet he has represented LaerteS, the father of
his favourite her0, as a wise prince, retiring from publick
business, and devoting his latter years to the tillage of his
land. Democritus, Xenophon, Aristotle, Theophrastus,
and several other Grecian Philosophers, have treated of
Agriculture in prose. Among the Romans, Cato the fa-
mous Censor has written a treatise of rural affairs, in which
he was imitated by the learned Varro. Cato writes like an
ancient country gentleman, of much experience3 he abounds
in short pithy sentenceS, intersperses his book with moral

But Virgil shines in a sphere far superior to the rest.

tua, till he was about thirty years of age, when he appear-
ed at Rome, and was soon received into the favour of
Augustus Caesar. virgil wanted nothing but the air of a
court, to add a polish to his uncommon share of parts and
learning. And bere he had the happiness to live under the
protection of the most powerful Prince in the world, and
to converse familiarly with the greatest men that any age
or nation ever produced. The Pastor-als of Theocritus were
much admired, and not undeservedly; but the Romans
had never see'n any thing of that kind in their own lan·
o‘uage. Virgil attempted it, and with such succeSS‚ that
iie has at least made the victory doubtful. The Latin
Eclogues discovered such a delicacy in their composition,
that the Author was immediately judged capable of arriving
