NOTES.

30. Ultima Thala] The King's
manuscript, and one of Dr. Mead’s
have it Thile3 in anoth‹›r of Dr.
Mead’s, and in the Cambridge ma-
nuscript, it is Tyle3 in the Bod-
leian manuscript it is Thyle. Thule
was thought by the Antients to be
the fartliest part of the earth towards

the north, and inaccessiblc3 thus
Claudian:

‘⁴ Ratibusque impervia Thule?

The place which the Romans meant
by Thule seems to be Schetland ;
for Tacitus tells us, it was in sight
of the Roman ficet, when Agricola
sailed round Britain, and Conquered
the Orkney islands. “ Hanc oram
“ novissimi maris tunc primum Ro-
“ mana classis circumvecta, insulam
“ esse Britanniam affirmavit, ac simul
“ incognitas ad id tempus insulas,
“ quas Orcadas vocant, invenit, do-
“ muitque. Dispecta est et Thule,
“ quam hactenus nix, et hyems ab·
“ debat.” ι

31. Teque sibi generum Tethys. 3512]
One of the Arundelian manuscripts,
and one of Dr. Mead’s‚ bave Theti„
wh1ch is certainly a mistak03 for the
first syllable of Thetis is short:

‘¹ Dilectae Thetidi halcyones.''

Tethys is the wife of Oceanus, aud
mother of the nymphs.

32. Turdis mensibus] By the slow
monilis he is generally understood to
mean the summer months, because
the days are then longest3 or pcr-
haps, became the summer signs riso
backwards, he might poetically feign
them to mox-e §lower than the re5t3
thus Manilius:

“ Quos] tria signa novem signis con«
⁶· Juncla repugnant,

“ Et quasi seditio caelum tenet. As-
“ pice Taurum

“ Clunibus, et Geminos pedibus,
‘¹ testudine Cancrum,

‘⁶ Surgere-3 cum rectis oriantur cae-
'-‘ tera membris.

⁴‘ Ne mirere in¹iras,cum Sol adversa
‘⁶ per astra

“ AEstivum tardis attollit mensibus

annum?

But Dr. Halley has favoured me with
the true meaning of these words,
which have given so much trouble
to th(- Commentators. Leo, Virgo,
Libra, and Scorpio, are really of
much slower aecenffion than the other
eight signs of the Zodiack; to which
virgil no doubt alluded.

33. Qua locus Erigonen inter, 55a]
Erigone is Virgo. Servius tells us,
that the Egyptians reckoned twelve

rugus,
