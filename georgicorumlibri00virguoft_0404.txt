364 P. VIRGILlI MARONIS

Thus Pan the god of Arcadia,
if we rnay give credit to the
story, deceived thee, Ο Moon,
being captivated with a snowy
offering of wool; nor did you
despise his invitation to corne
into the lofty woods. But
those who desire to have milk,
must give them with theu· own
hands plenty of cytisus and
water-lines, and lay salt neibs
in their cribs. This makes

Pan deus Arcadiae captain te, Luna, fefellit,

In nemora alta vocans : nec tu aspernata vo·
cantem.

At cui lactis amor, cytisos, lotosque frequentes

Ipse manu, salsasque ferat praesepibus herbas.

Hinc et amant fluvios magis, et magis ubera

thern fonder of drinking. and

and gives an obscure relish of
salt to their milk. Many re-

NOTES.

whitest, was deceived‚ because they
were the worst sheep. But surely,
if the whitest sheep were the worst in
the floek, it would not have answered
Virgil’s purpose, to have alluded to
the sable. I rather believe the sable,
which our Poet meant, was as Phi-
largyrius and some others have re-
lated it3 that Pan changed himself
into a ram as white as snow‚ by which
the Moon was deceived, as Europa
was by Jupiter, in the form of a white
bull.

394. Αἰ cuz· lactis amor, &c.] This
paragraph informs uS, that those who
seed sheep for the sake of their milk,
must afford them great plenty of
proper nourishment.

394. Cytisum] See the note on

book II. ver. 431.
Letoa] I have ventured to translate

this water-lilies on the creditos Pros-
per Alpinus. See the note on book ΙΙ.
ver. 84. The great white water lily
grows in rivers and deep ditches.

395. Ipsa] Pierius says it is ille
in the Roman and Medicean manu-
scripts, but he justly prefers ipse, as
being more emphatical. I find ille
in the King's and both the Arunde.
lian manuscripts, and some of the
oldest printed editions.

*S'alsasqaeserat praesepibus herbam]
Columella does not approve the giving
of marsh herbs to sheep that are in
health3 he recommends salt to be
given them when they are sick‚ and
refuse their sood and drink. ‘⁶ Ju-
‘4 cundissimas herbas esse, quae ara.
‘⁶ tro proscissis arvis nascantur: dein.
“ de quae pratis uligine carentibus:
‘⁶ palustres, sylvestresque minime ido-
‘⁶ neas haberi: nec tamen ulla sunt

‘⁶ nem bibendi, pascendique conci.
‘⁶ piunt.”

398. Jam.] It is etiam in the
King’s and in both the Arundelian.
manuscripts.

399. Ferraris capistris] These
munies, of which the Poet speaks,
are not such as confine the mouth of
the lamb or kid, for then it could
not eat. They areiron spikes fasten-
ed about the snout, which prick the
dam, is she offers tolet her young

one suck. 402 σα
