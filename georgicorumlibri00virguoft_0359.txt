speaks only of the generous horse,
- which is fit either for the races or war:

“ Sin ad bella magis studium, tur..

“ Et Jovi's in luco currus agitare vo-
‘⁶ lantes.'‘

Here is no mention of domestic la-
bour, but only of chariots and war.
La Cerda observes that the esseda
were ueed by private persons, in
travelling, as well asin war3 as ap„

ic e ius veni mi ι 0 viam
‘f cum duobus essedis, et rheda equis
‘⁶ juncta, et lectica, et familia mag-
‘⁶ na.’' There is another passage
of the sanie kind in the second Phi-
lippic oration ε ‘⁶ Vehebatur in essedo
“ tribunus plebiS.” But Virgil shews
that he does not mean the common
charum, or esseda, by adding the
epithet Belgica, or perhaps bellica, as
it is in one of Dr. Mead‘s manu-
scripts, for we do not find the cha-
riots of war ascribed to the Gauls,
but to the Britons. Cicero mentions
them in some of his Epistles to
Trebatius, who was in Britain with
Caesar: “Tu qui caeteris cavere
‘⁶ didicisti, in Britannia ne ab esse-
‘⁶ dariis decipiaris, caveto:’' and
“ In Britannia nihil esse audio, ne-
“ que auri, neque argenti. Id si ita
ᾳ est, essedum aliquod suadeo rapias,

ξξ et ad nos quam primum recurras :'’

and “Sed tu in re militari multo es
“ cautior, quam in advocationibusz‘
‘⁴ qui neque in oceano natare vo-
‘⁶ lueris,studiosissimus homo natandi,
‘⁶ neque spectareessedarios.” Caesar
does not once mention the ess-edam,
in his war with the Belgae: but we
find them taken notice of, as soon
as he approaches the British shoar:
‘⁴ At barbari, consilio Romanorum
‘⁶ cognito, praemisso equitatu, et
‘⁴ essedariis, quo plerumquegenere in
‘⁶ praeliis uti consuerunt, reliquis co-
‘⁶ piis subsecuti, nostros navibus egre-
‘⁶ di prohibebant.⁷' A little after..
wards we find him describing the
manner in which the Britons fought
with these esseda, as if he had not
met with them in his other παῖε. Ι
must therefore confess, I do notun-
derstand why Virgil calls them Bel.
