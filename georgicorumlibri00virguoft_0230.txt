NOTES.

‘⁴ Alps: for that is called Vesulus,
‘⁵ and is nwntimwd by Vir-gil in ano-
“ther place: ls'csulus qucm pini 'er
“ (iflirc. But the Vesevus, of which
“ Vix-gii speaks in this place, is a
“ mountain of Campania, called also
‘³ [lesan-ius and Vesvius? PIER1US.

⁴225. Orus] Aulus Gellius tells us,
that lie had niet with an account.
that virgil wrote at first vicina Vesevo
Nolajngo‚ but that being afterwards
not peranitted, by the people of that
city, to bring down some water to
his neighbouring farm, he altered
Nola to ora. Aulus Gellius seems to
give no great credit to this old story.

Vacuis (lanius mm aequus Acerras]
Acfrne is the name of a very ancient
city of Campania, which was almost
depopulated by the frequent inunda-
tions of the river Clanius.

226. Nunc, quo quamque modo=
ἂρ] The l‘oet having, in the pre-
ceding paragraph, informed us of the
benefits and disadvantages of the se-
veral sorts of soil, he now proceeds
to instruct us how we may be able to
disiinguish each ofthem.

227. Rara ········ densa] ΜΓ.
B—-- translates these words light
and hear-y: but of these the Poet
speaks afterwards. Julius Graecinus,
as 1 find him quoted by Columella,

suffieiently explains what is the true
meaning of thern. Densa signifies
such a soil, as will not easily admit
tho rain, is easily crackt‚ and apt to
gape. and so let in the sun to the
roots of the vines. and in a manner
to strangle the young plants. This
therefore must be a hard or stiffsoil.
Rara, says he, lets the showers quite
thr0'‚ and is apt to be dried up with
the sun. Therefore this rnust be a
haose soil. ‘⁵ Per-densam humum cae-
“ lestes aquas non sorbere, nec fa-
“ cile perflari, facillime perrumpi.
‘⁴ et praebere rimas, quibus sol ad
‘⁶ radices stirpium penetret: eadem-
“ que velut conclausa, et coarctata
‘⁶ semina comprimere, atque stran-
“ gulare. Raram supra modum velut
“ per infundibulum transmittere im·
“ brt-S, et sole ac vento penitus sic-
“ cari, atque exarescere.”

930. sambra] Pierius says it is
videbis in the Medicean manuscript.
1 find the same reading in the. old
Nurenberg edition.

231. In solida] The Poet says
you should dig in a solid place3 sor
if it was hollow, the ex periment would
be to no purpose.

v 2353. Deerunt] Itis deerirttinone
of Dr. Mead's manuscripts, and deerit
in the old Nurenberg edition: but

deerunt
