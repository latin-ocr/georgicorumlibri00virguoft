GEORG.

Lenaeos; ea visa salus morientibus una. Δ
Mox erat hoc ipsum exitio, furiisque refecti
Ardebant, ipsique suos, jam morte sub aegra,
Dii meliora piis, erroremque hostibus illum!
Discissos nudis laniabant dentibus artus.
Ecce autem duro fumans sub vomere taurus

LIB. III. 385

510 Lenaean liquor: this seemed the

only hope to preserve them
from death: but afterwards
even this was their destruction:
and being recruitcd with rage
they bui-ned: and, [oh‘. may
the gods give a better mind to
the pinus, and that error to
tlieirenemies ἲ) when they were
in the 1›angs of death, they
tore their own mangled flesh
with their naked teeth. But
lo the buu smoaking under

NOTES.

‘² A drcnch of wine has with success
‘⁶ been us'd3

‘⁶ And thro* a horn the gen'rous
‘⁴ jtiice infus'd:

‘⁴ Which timelytaken op'dhisclosing
ιι -aws .

ζ( But ils too, late, the patIent's death
‘⁴ did cause.

‘⁴ For the too vig’rousdose too fierccly
‘⁴ wrought 3

‘⁶ And added sury to the strength it
‘⁶ brought.

‘⁴ Recruited into rage he grinds his
⁴‘ tecth

‘⁴ In his own flesh, and feeds ap-
“ proaehing death.'’

This sense is very goodz hut 1 be-
lieve it is not that which virgil
meant.

513. Dic· meliora piis, Sta] This
was a frequent form among the An-
eients os expressing their abhorrent-e
os any great mischies, hy wishing it
from themseives to their enemies.
Something like this is in the eighth
AEneid:

‘⁴ Quid memorem infandas caedes?
“ qnid facta tyranni

’ὅ Effera? Dii cupe'tiz'psiecs generique
‘⁴ reservent.’'

Error-em] Pierius says it is ar-
dorem in the Roman manuscript.

514. Discissos nudis laniabant den·
libus artum] In one of Dr. Mead’s
manuscripts it is Daeffissos.

‘2 The word nudis seems to imply,
(ί that by tearing their fiesh‚ they at
‘⁴ the same time tore the gums from
“their teeth, ut fa’clitatem expri-
“ meret, adjecit malis ,· says a Com-v
‘⁶ mentator in the ls'arior. And
‘² what he means I know not.'’
Dr. Trapp.

This Commentator is Philargy-
rius. I take his meaning to be, that
the gums being uicerated, aud rotted
away from their tenth, was a filthy
sight3 which every one must allow
that has seen it.

Though perhaps by nalced leeth the
Poet mayintend to express the horrid
grinning of the horse in the agonies
of death : sor Lueretius has used the
same expression sor the grinning of
dogs :

“Mollia ricta fremunt duros nudan-
“ le'u deutes.''

As the Poet had before spoken of
bulis and horses together, when he
treated of their generation, and the
ways of managing them ; so now he
joins them in distress7 and describes
the misc-ry os the bull immediateiy

afterg‘hat of the horse. This passage,
