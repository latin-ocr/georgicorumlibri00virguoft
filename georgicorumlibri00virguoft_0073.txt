NOTES.

The grammatic-al construction of
this passage does not seem very clear.
Coeditur is made to agree with tilia,
fagus, and stiva. We may say tilia
caeditur, and firgus anditum but to
say at the sanie time stiva coeditm·
seems to be absurd : for this makes
the staffof a trec, by couplinglit with

·lime and beecb. Resides que and quw,

coming close together offend the ear,
andl believe there is not another in-
stance of their coming thus together
any where iu virgil. I believe in-
· stead of sliwque we ought to read
,stiae·ae; which will make the sense
.clearer‚ and the verse the better:

“ Caeditur et tilia ante jugo levis,
“ altaque fagus

“ Stivae, quae currus a tergo torqueat
“ imos.’'

“ The light lime-trec also is cut down
“ beforehand for the yoke, and the
“ tall beech for the staff, to turn the
“ bottom of the carriage behind.”
The Bodleian manuscript has stiva
que currus. v

Currus] “I. do not know whe—
“ ther any edition justifies the alte-
“ ration 1 have made in this line, of
“ currus to cursus. The reason of
“ my doing it is because (ιω-,ςιιε is in-
“ telligible‚ and explains the use of
“ the handle, οι· plough staff; cur-sus
‘¹ torquent imos, the handle serves to
‘⁶ keep the plough up, which otber-
“ wise would run down too deep in
“ the ground. ΜΓ. Dryden finding
“ this passage difficult to explain,
‘⁴ has lest it quite ont of his transla-

¹‘ tion. All that the commentators
“ have said concerning currus, in
“ this place is very perplex1.’' Mr.

The Poet is thought by some to
mean a wheel plough, by the word
curru-9, which is derived from curro,
ίονιιης and Servius informs υς, that
in Virgil's country, the ploughs run
upon wheds, we have wheel-plouglis
in many parts of England.

175. Erphrat] The King's, the
Bodleian, and one of the Arundeliau
manuscripts, have exploret. Servum,
La Cerda, Scin-evenus, and seweral
printed editions have the sanie read-
ing. Pierius seems willing to admit
exploret.- tho' at the same time he
says it is explorat in the Roman ma·
nuscript, and in the very ancient ob-
long one. Heinsius and Ruaeus read
explorat. 11 is the same in the other
Arundvlian, the Cambridge, and
both Dr. Mcad's manuscripts.

Iliave bere inserted the figure of
a modern Italian plough, which seems
to differ but little froin that which
Virgil lias described. It seems to
have no stix-a, distinct from the bu-
ri33 and it has acmultcr, which Vir-
gil does not mention. And indeed
Pliny, who describes the coulter,
seems to speak as if it was not in all
ploughs. *⁵ Vomeruni plura genera.
‘⁴ Culter vocatur, praedensam, prius
‘⁶ quum proscindatur, terram secans,
‘³ futurisque sulcis vestigia praescri-
“ bens incisuris, quas resupinus in
“ arando mordeat vomer?
