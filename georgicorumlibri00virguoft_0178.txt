It must not be (lenito, that not-
withstanding our Poet seems to inen-
tion the. oak, palin, and fir, as being
propagatori by suckers, yet these trees
are never known to produce any, nor
were they ever propagated any other
way, than by seeds. It has been sug-
gested to nie by an ingenious friend,
that what Virgil says of suckers is
terminated with the end of ver. 66,
and that Chaonii patris glandes, ὅγε.
signifies that ‘⁵' oaks grow from seeds,
“ as does also the lol‘ty palm, and the
‘⁴ fir, which is to try the ‹langers of
‘⁶ the sea. Ι much question whe-
ther the words of our author can be
brought to this sense, but Ι leave it
to the determination of the learned
reader.

'rho oak was sacred to Jupi-

Ardua palma] The palm (Ι be-
lieve) has this epithet on account of
it's great height. Some think it is
called ardua, because the honour of
the palm is difficult to be obtained.
Mr. Miller thinks it is called ardua,
because “ it is with difficulty propa-
‘· gated, and is of slow growth, so
“that the persons, who plant the
‘² stones‚ seldom live to taste the fruit
“ of their labour.'’

68. Casus abies visura marinos]
The abies is our yae-leaves! fir-trce.
The woocl ot' this tree was much used
by the ancients in their shipping.

69. Inseritur vero esc fletu nucis

arbutus horrida] 1 believe there is

no passage, in all the Georgicks,
uhich has been more censured, than
this about grafting: it being a re-
ceived opinion, that no grat't will
suem-cd, unless it be upon a stock,
which bears a fruit of the same kind.
IIence this is looked upon as a mere
poetical rant, to talk of grafting a
walnut on an arbuto, an apple on a
plane, a beech on a chesnut‚ a pear
on a wihl asli, and an oak on an elm.
Whether the present art falls short of
that of the ancletus, or whether our
climate will not admit of the same
advantages‚ with the better air of Ita-
ly, 1 will not pretend to determine.
But Ι shall endeavour to strengthen
what our Poet has said, by the autbo-
rity ofthe best, the most experienced,
and the most judicious prose writer
on agriculture, amongst the ancients.
Columella spends a whole chapter, in
his book de Arboribus, in showing
how any cion may be grafted on any
stock. 1 shall present the reader with
a translation of that entire chapter.
“ But since the ancients have denied
“ that every kind of cion may be in-
“ grafted on very tree, and have
“ determined this as a perpetual law,
“ that those cions only can succeed‚
“ which are like in outer and inner
“ bark, and fruit, to those trees on
⁴* which they are ingrafted, we have
“ thought it proper to remove this
“ mistake, and deliver to posterity
‘⁴ the method by which every kind
“ of cion may be ingrafted on every
“ kind of tree. But not to tire the
