NOTES.

423, Acersmn alumine] Inone
of Dr. Mcad’s manuscripts, it is (trer-
snm lumine without (ι. Pierius found
the same reading in most of the an-
cient manuscripts.

4⁶21.. Res-etesia] Some read reces-
sit ,· but all the ancient manuscripts,
according to Pierius, have resistit.
It is resistit in all the manuscripts
that Ι have seen. ,

425. Jam rapidae, &c.] Here
the Poet uses a beautiful circumlo-
cution, to express the middle of one
of the hottest days in summer.
Sirius, a star of the first magnitude
in tkc mouth of the dog, rises about
the time of the sun's enter-ing into
Leo, towards the latter end of July,
making what we call the dog days.
He shews it to be the time of noon,
by saying the sun had finished the
middle or half of his course. All
these words, rapidus, torrem, si-
tienter, Indos, ardebat, igneus, are

'expressive of great heat. He en-
larges the idea, by representing the
grass burnt up, and the rivers boiled
to mud. It was the violent heat that
caused Proteus to retire into his cave,
where he would be the more easily

surprised‚ being fatigued and glad to
sleep.

4⁶27. Arehant] Itis ardebant in
the King's manuscript.

431. Di.³·persz't.] Itis commonly
read dispergit: but Pierius found
dispersit in the Medicean and other
manuscripts. I lind dispersit in the
King’s‚ both the Arundelian‚ and in
both Dr. Mead's manuscripts. This
reading is admitted also by Heinsius
and Masvicius.

Amorum] The sea. water is really
bitter as well as salt. Homer has
used the same epithet :

Hiszv ἀποπνείουσαι ἁλὸς πολυζενθέος ὄδ-

r
μζϊ.

432. Diversae] So Pierius found
it in the Roman and other manu..
seripts of greater note. Iu one of
the Arundelian manuscripts, in the
old Nurenberg edition, and in Schre,
veliuS, it is diverso. But diversae is
received by Heinsius, and most of the

good Editors.
