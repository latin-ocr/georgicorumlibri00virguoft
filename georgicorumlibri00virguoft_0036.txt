NOTl-IS.

certainly the accusative case plural,
for the construction will not admit
os its being the genitive singulam
wherefore, to avoid confusion, I have
put urbes. Drydcn imagined urbis
to be the genitive case singulam and
that Vix-gil meant particularly the
city os Rome:

‘⁵ whether-in after times to be de·
“ clar'd,

‘⁸ The patron of the world, and
“ lome's peculias guard.'’

Invisere] La Corda observes that
this word is expressive of Divinitas,
and quot S several passages from the
Poets in confirmation of his opi-
nion. ’

27. Tempestatumque potentem]
These words are generally under-
stood to mean, that Augustus should
be the ruler of the seasons. But l
think Virgil has seldorn, if ever, used
tempestates to signify the seasons.
Sure lam that many passages may
be produced where he has expressed
storms by that word. I shall content
myself with one in the first AEneid,
where AEolus speaks in the following
manner to Juno:

“ Tu mihi quodcunque hoc regni,
‘⁴ tu sceptra, Jovornque

‘⁴ Concilias: tu das epulis accumbere
“ divfim,

“ Nimborumque facis, tempestatum-
“ que potentem.'’

Pliny explains tempestates, hail,
storius, and such like: ‘⁶ Ante om-
⁴‘ nia autem duo genera esse cae-
“ lestis injuriae meminisse ‹lebe-
“ mus. Unum quod tempestates
“ vocamus, in quibus grandines, pro-
“ cellae, coeteraque similia intelli-
guntur ’'

Mr. 13- translates it in this sense3

Η

“ Parent of fruits, and pow'rful of

“ the storm.’'

The Poet meam, no doubt, that
Augustus shall govern the storms in
such a manner, that they shall not
injure the fruit< of the earth.

28. Cz'ngens materna tempora myr-
t0.] The myrtle uas sacred to Venus,
as* virgil tells us himself in the seventh
Eclogue:

“ Populus Alcidae gratissima, vitis
⁴‘ Iaccho,
“ Formosae myrtus Vene1·i.'‘

He pays a fine compliment to Au·
gustus in this passage, making him,
as he was very desirous to have it
thought, to be descended from ΖΕ-
neas, who was the son of Venus.
The same expression is used with

regare] to AEneas himself, in the fifth
AEneid:

“ Sic fatus, {relat materna tempora
“ myrtos
