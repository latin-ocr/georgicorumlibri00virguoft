NOTES.

Italy make their beds os the down
of the cat's-tail, instead of feathers:
and the same author informs us, that
there is hardly a standing water in
Italy, which does not abound with
cat's-tail.

176. Frumento mmm carpes salsa]
Servius interprets this farrago, that
is, a mixt provender of wheat bran,
and barley meal. Grimoaldus also
paraphrases it farra szquedilahis et
ordea. La Cerda is of the same
opinion: which he strengthens by a
quotation from Varr0, where he tells
us, acalf of six months old is to be
fed with wheat bran, barley meai,
and tender grass: ‘⁶ Semestribus vi-
‘4 tulis objiciunt furfures triticeos, et
‘⁶ farinam ordeaceam, et teneram
‘⁶ herbam.” Ruaeus differs from the
other Commentators: he understands
the Poet 1ο mean young corn. This
he consu-ms by the words carpes
sata, which plainly express the gather-
ing of the tender blade3 and by
ver. 205, where he forbids givingfar-
rago to the cattle before they are
tamed. Hence hc concludes, either
.- that Virgil contradicts Varro, or
else that he means that the farrago
should be given sparingly to the
cattle, before they are tamed, and
plentisully afterwards. Dryden fol-
lows Ruaeus:

‘⁶ ‘Their wanton appetites not only
‘¹‘ Wiihddelicates of leaves, and
‘⁶ marshfweed,

‘⁶ But with thy sickle reap the rank-
‘⁵ est land:

‘⁵ And minister the blmle, with boun.
“ teous hand.”

Dr. Trapp is of the same opinion :

‘4 Mean-while with grass alone, and
‘⁶ leaves, and sedge

‘⁶ Feed not thy untam’d bullock83
‘⁶ but with corn

‘² Cropt in the blade.”

Nec le'bz‘ Vfoeloe, &c.] The people
in the earliest ages lived much upon
milk3 and therefore defrauded their
calves of great part os their natural
nourishment. This practice Virgil
condemns, and advises those, who
breed calvos, to let them suck their

177. Mula-traria] So I read with
Heinsius, and some of the oldest
editors, I find the same reading in
the King’s, the Cambridge, and
both Dr. Mead's manuscripts. Pierius ⁶
found mulctraria also in the Roman,
the oblong, and some other manu-
scriptS. In the Medicean and some
others he found mzcllrale'a. He found
mulgaria also in some of the most
ancient copie53 and observes, that
in the Lombard manuscript mul.
traria had been slightly erased, and
mulgaria substituted for it.

179. Sin cul bella, &c.] The
Poet now proceeds to give an account
of the breeding of horses.
