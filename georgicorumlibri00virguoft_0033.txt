NOTES.

fine Stallion‚ he mentions as the most “ Maenalus, famous for the pastoral

excellent, that hc should be descended “ pipe,

from the horse of Neptune:

“ Et patriam Epirum referat, fortes-
“ que Mycena*

“ Neptunique ipsa deducat origine
“ gentein.’'

14. Cultor nemorum, agna] He means
Aristaeus, the son of Apollo and Cy—
rene. This Aristaeus was educated
by the Nymphs, who taught him
the arls of curdling milk, making
bec-hives, and cultivating olive-trees.
He communicated these benefits to
mankind, on which account he had
the same divine honours pald to him
as to Bacchus.

Ceae.] A very fruitful island, in
the Archipelago, ιο which Aristaeus
retired after the unfortunate death of
his son Actaeou. 11e was there first
worshipped as a deity.

16. Ipse nemus linquens patrium,
dc] Pan’s country is Arcadia, in
which were the mountains Lycaeus'
and Maenalus, and the city Tegea.

17. Si] Grimoaldus interprets ὁὶ
by quantum-cis, and gives this passage
the lollowing sense: “And thee, O
‘⁶ Arcadian Pan, the illustrious seed-
“ er of sheep, l most earnestly in-
“ treat: that though. thy mountain

‘a

affords thee great pleasure;
“ yet leave thy native soil a little
while, and engage entirely iu over-
seeing our affairs? Ruaeus gives
it this sense: “ lf thou hast any
“ regard for Maenalus‚ LycaeuS‚ and‘
the other mountains and woods of
thy own Arcadia, leave now those
places, and assist inc whilst I speak
of pastoral affairs and trees: sor

‘S

‘t
U
a<
(ί

“ my discourse will do honour to

‘⁶ these places, and be of use to them.''
I have followed this sense, astho most
generally received.

18. Tegeoee.] Servius and Heinsius
read Tegoee,· one of the Arundelian
manuscripts has Tegehe,· in the Cam-
bridge, the Bodleian, and one of
Dr. Mead's manuscripts it is Tegee,-
ιιι the Kiug’s manuscript, and in
some of the old printed editions. it is
'J'egeae,· La Corda aud Ruaeus read
Tegeoee‚ which seems to be right, sor
the two first syllables are always
short; the Greek name of the city
being Τεγέα.

Olcoeqtce filimer-ca Invcntri.r.] This
alludes to the story οι the conteution
between Neptune and Minerva, about
naming Athens. Pliny says the
olive-trec produced on that occasion
by Minerva was to be seen in his
time at Athens.
