In the passage now before us he re-
presents their degenerate posterity
astonished at the bones of the Ro-
mam, who fell at Pharsalia and Phi-
lippi, which in comparison of those
of later ages may be accounted gi-
gantick.

498. Dii patrii δια] The Poet
concludes the first book5 witha prayer
to the gods of Rome, to preserve

Augustus, and not to take him yet
into their number, that he may save
mankind srom ruin.

The Commentators differ about
the signification of the words Diipcca
tre'e'72'71de'gete.9: some think the Die·
patrii and the indz'geles are the same 3
to which opinion Ruaeus subscribes.
Servius, with better reason, separates
them, and observes that the Dz'z'pa.v
triz' are those which preside over
particular cities, as Minerva over
Athens, and Juno over Carthage,
They are also called Penates: and in
the second AEneid our Poet himself
‘seems to make the Dii patrii and Pe⁶ A
nates the same. Anchises invokes the
Diipatrz'e' to preserve his family:

‘⁶ Dii patrii, servate domum, servate
‘⁴’ nepotem.’'

And immediately sEneas desires him
to take with him the patrii Penates ,⁴

‘⁶ Tu, genitor, cape sacra manu, pa:
“ triosque Penates .·

ovid, at the end of his Metamorphoa
sis, has an invocation for the safety
of Augustus; wherein he mentions
these Penates, which AEneas carried
with him, as different from the Dii
indigetes:

‘⁶ Dii precor, AEneae comites, quibus
‘⁶ ensis et ignis s

‘⁶ Cesserunt, De'z'que indigetes, genia
