NOTES.

⁶⁶ quoque vertatur, non olivarium
⁶⁶ modo, sed frumentarium 9113111
‘⁶ sieri poteritff’ May’s translation
is to the same purpose z

‘⁶ The earth itselfe, when furrow'd by
⁶⁶ the plough,

⁶⁶ Doth food enough 0111191, and corne
⁶⁶ bestow.”

La Cerda takes dente mico and vomere
to be only two expressions for 1119
plough-share : he contends that salis
is 1119 3(11 erb, and that fruges means
the fruit of the olives: ⁶⁶ Nam tellus
⁶⁶ ipsa quocunque aratro, quocunque
⁶⁶ 10111919 invertatur (adeo non ne.
⁶⁶ cessarii rastri) praebet humorem,

ς(1111511115 3(1 01935. Illud grazidae
⁶⁶ fruges sunt 1p51ssimae oleae.
⁶⁶ Male enim aliqui per fruges 93-
⁶⁶ piunt frumenta. Male etiam per
⁶⁶ vocem satis accipiunt sata, cum
⁶⁶ hic sit adverbium.” Ruaeus fol..
10115 Servius as to satis, and Gri-
moaldus as to dente zcnco; but 119
gives quite a new interpretation of
cum vome? e: ⁶⁶ Id est statim atque
⁶⁶ aperitur vomere, sine mora, pro.
⁶⁶ ducit fructus. Exaggeratio, quae
⁶⁶ certum et celerem proventum in-
⁶⁶ dicat.’' Dr. Trapp approves of
this new interpretation:

⁶⁶ The earth itself, when by the bi-
⁶⁶ ting share
⁶· [111111111Ἆᾶ sufficient moisture will
⁶⁶ sup1p31y
‘⁶ And full fruit, aith the labem of
plough
⁶⁶ Col‘e't οἱ,5 ⁷’

2⁶⁷3 F⁰1 that? says he, ⁶⁶ is the mean„

⁶⁶ ing of cum vomere. Hyperb. al.
⁶⁶ most as soon as, &cs As sor satis,
Ithink the sense is much the same,
whether we take it to be the noun or
the ’11119111Β97119 unco Ι take to
mean the balens or drag, spoken of
before, which is used in the culture
of olives, according to Columella,
to break and loosen the ground, that
the sun may not pierce thro’ the
chinks, and 111111 1119 10015; ⁶⁶ Sed
⁶⁶ id minime bis 311110 arari debet,
⁶⁶ et bidentibus alte circumfodiri,
⁶⁶ Nam post solstitium cum terra

⁶⁶ 'aestibus hiat, curandum 951, 119

⁶⁶ per rimas sol ad radices arborum ⁷

⁶⁶ penetret.’' I do not find that it
was usual to 5011Ρ corn amongst the
olives, but plowing thes ground was
universally thought to increase their
product: therefore I agree with La
Cei-da, that fruges means the fruits
of the olive, and not corn. Ι take
1119 sense of these lines to be this3
⁶⁶ If you break the ground with
⁶⁶ drags, it will keep the sun from
⁶⁶ drying the roots, and the earth,be-
⁶⁶ ing loosened, will let as much
⁶⁶ moisture soak to them as is suf.
⁶⁶ ficient: and if)ou plow the ground
⁶⁶ you will have a greater crop ot·

⁶⁶ olives. ’⁷ Mr. B———has translated
it 111 11115 591159.

⁶⁶ The earth herself the plants sup.³
⁶⁶ plies with juice,
