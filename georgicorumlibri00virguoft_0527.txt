NOTESo

‘⁶ So Philomel, beneath a poplar
⁶⁶ shade,

⁶⁶ Laments her young by some rude
⁶⁶ haud betray'd. ,

⁶⁶ All night in mournful notes she
⁶⁶ seeks relies,

‘⁶ And the widewoods re-echo to her
‘⁶ grief.’'

Populea] The poplar is judi-
clously chosen by the Poet, on this
occasion, because the lenies of this
t'ree trembling with the least breath
of air, make a sort of melancholy
rustliug.

Philomela]v Servius thinks the
Poet puts the nightingale here for
any bird: but surely what the Poet
says here could not be applied to any
other bird.

We have already seen the story of
Philomela and Procne, in the note
on ver. 15. Thereis adifferent story
of Philomela, which is related by
Mr. Pope,' in a note on the nineteenth
Odyssey, in the soll-owing manner:
‘⁶ Pandareus, son of Merops, had
⁶⁶ three daughters, Merope, Cleo-
⁶⁶ thera, and A'edon. Pandareus
⁶⁶ married his oldest daughter Aedon
‘⁶ to Zethus, brother of Amphion,
‘⁶ mentioned ln the eleventh Odyssey· ,
‘⁶ she had an only son named Itylus3
‘⁶ aad belng envious at the numerous
‘⁶ family of her brother- m- law Am.
‘⁶ phion, she resolves to murther Amas
⁶⁶ leus, the eldest of her nephews3
‘⁶ her own son Itylus was brought up
‘⁶ with the children of Amphion, and

⁶⁶ lay in the same bed with this Amaa'
⁶⁶ leus. A'edon ‹lirects her son Ity-
‘⁶ lus to absent himself oue night
⁶⁶ from the bed, but he sorgets her
‘⁶ orders3 at the time determiued she
⁶⁶ conveys herself into the apart-
⁶⁶ ment, and mni-ders her own son
⁶⁶ Itylus, bymistake, instead of her
⁶⁶ nephew Amaleus: L.1}tiis al„
‘⁶ mos t in distracti ιη. she beg s the
⁶⁶ gods to remor e her fr rom the rar e
“of human-⁵ kind, they grant her
⁶⁶ prayer, and change her into a
⁶⁶ nightingaleffl Aedonis the Greek
name for a nightingale, and is there„
fore the same with Philomela. It is
to this story that Homer alludes in
the nineteenth Οὐ) ssey :
