citur cestus] Aristotle says that Bees
live six years, and that some last Seven;
but if a swarm subsiste, nine or ten
years, it is thought very happy:

brought to live above 100 years:

this paragraph the Poet compares the
obedience of the Bccs tQ their King,
with that of the most servile nations,
the Egyptians, Lydians, Parthians,
and Mcdes3 which he takes from
Aristotle. ⁶⁶ The Kings, says the
Philosopher, ⁶⁶ never go abroad to

- ⁴⁶ seed or on any other occasion,

‘⁶ without being accompanied by
‘⁶ the whole multitude: and if,
⁶⁶ when they arc abroad, the King
⁶⁶ happens to stray, they all search
⁶⁶ after him with the utmost dili..
⁶⁶ genoe, till they find him. 'We
‘⁶ have been informed also, that,
