GEORG. LIB. IV.

Tum variae eludent species atque ora ferarum.

Fiet enim subito sus horridus, atraque tigriS‚
Squamosusque draco, et fulva cervice leaena:

Aut acrem flammae sonitum dabit, atque ita vinclis
Excidet, aut in aquas tenues dilapsus abibit. ι410
Sed quanto ille magis formas se vertet in omnes,
Tanto, nate, magis contende tenacia vincla ς
Donec talis erit mutato corpore, qualem
Videris, incepto tegeret cnm lumina somno.
Haec ait, et liquidnm ambrosiae diffundit odorem ;
Quo totum nati corpus perduxit: at illi 416
Dulcis compositis spiravit crinibus aura,
Atque habilis membris venit vigor. Est specus ingens
Exesi latere in montis, quo plurima vento

Cogitur, inque sinus scindit sese unda reductos 3 420
Deprensis 011111 statio tutissima nautis.

Intus se vasti Proteus tegit objice saxi.

a yeilow mane: or else he will
make a roa.ing like tire, 10
escape 1110 chains, or glide
away in the form of flowing
water. But 1110 more 110 varies
himself into all sliapess, do yon,
my son, so mncli the inore
straiten the binding chains:
tiil he shall transform liis body
11110 the same shape that you
saw 111111 liare when 110 first
went to sleep. 1111111113,Γ said
thus, she poured the liquid
odour of Ambrosia upon her

with it ς. whence a fragrant gale
breatlies from 1115 hair, and
strong vigour is infuscd into
liis limbs. Thereis a great den
in the hoilow side of a moun-
tain, where much water is dri·

times* a most safe station sor
mariners in distress. WVithin
this place Proteus hides him·

editions, and Heinsius and Masvicius.
Pierius found ludent in the Roman
manuscript, eludunt in the old ob-

the Medicean, and most of the an-
cient ones. It is illudent in both
the Arundelian‚ and in the other ma-
nuscript of Dr. Mead, which is ad-
mitted by La Corda, SchreveIius, and
Ruaeus. Many read illudunt.
