463. Lac concretum cum sanguine
potat equina] This cus‘rom of drink-
ing milk and iiorse’s blood is afferibed
to the Massagetae, a people of Scythia,
by Dionysius-

Pliny mentions the Sarmaloe as mix-
ing millet with the milk of mai-ec,
orthe blood drawn out of their legs:
‘⁶ Sarmatarum quoque gentes nze
“maxime pulte aluntur, et cruda
‘⁶ etiam farina equino lacte vel san..
‘⁴ guine e cruris venis admixtoss’
Tine same is said by omer audior-s,
os different nations inhabiting those
parts·

464. Aua] It is ut in the King's
manuscript.

Siccceclere] ln one of the Arunde·³
lian manuscripts 11 is succumbere„

Samium] In the King’s manuscript
it is mollius. .

465. lgr-mins] Pierius found
segnius in i'ne Roman manuscript.

467. Et.] The conjunctior! is
omitted in one of Dr. Mead's 11131111,
scripts.

Sera> nocta] Pierius says it is sera
nocte iu the ancient manuscripts.

468. Continuo cubmm ferro com*
pesce] Most of the printed editions,
and all tlw manuscripts which l have
coliated7 have continno ferro culpam,
which seems very unharmonious. Ser-
vius reads continuo culpam ferro,
which order of the words Pierius also
found in the Roman, the Medicean,
and other very ancient manuscripts.
I have found the same order in two
oid editions z'n solio, printed at Venice
in 1475 and 1476, and in an old
edition of the Georgieks in octavo,
printed at Paris in 1495. The same
is admitted also by La Corda and
Heinsius.

Servius interprets culpanzserro com-
pesce 1ο mean, that the shepherd by
kining an insected slietp avoids being
guilty& himself of a crime, in suffering

it to live 1ο the damage of the w hole⁴
